Meaning they mate once in their lifetime and die right after. Sadly the octopus lifespan ranges only from 6 months to 5 years depending on the type.They love to garden for Pete’s sake! Collecting attractive things for their own protection but also to attract mates and prey. The males will flash their skin displays to win a lady octopus over.Did they win you over yet?

They can solve mazes, open jars, use “tools” AND they have both short and long term memory. 2/3 of their neurons are in their appendages, and have the largest brain of any invertebrate. The oldest octopus fossil is over 296 million yrs old.They love to munch on clams, lobsters, shrimp, fish, sharks, and even birds. The octopus typically drops down on its prey and envelopes it with its arms, pulling it into their mouth.Not only do they maneuver with their suction cups, their sense of taste is most developed in the suckers. An octopus can also taste things with their skin and even their eyelids!A sucka octopus? Neva. They are STRONG. They can have up to 280 suckers per limb (6 arms and 2 legs) Meaning they can have up to 2,240 suction cups. The largest sucker of the Pacific Octopus can lift up to 35lbs. Imagine!! ONE sucker can lift your 3 or 4 year old child 😂They have no bones, the only hard part of their body is their beak. Yes, a beak. Like a little alien water birdie. It’s located on its underside where the arms converge. They’re so squishy that a 100lb octopus can squeeze through an opening the size of an orange! Cara...

Are we saying that France and Belgium are dirty? 🤔 We pushed France uphill overnight and are now letting it roll back down the hill to make electricity Interesting. Would they not have had to pay the excess over the contract price but still have received a net payment due to the high wholesale price received? Or is this a specific clause due to localised grid constraints or something. I link to any info would be appreciated 悲しい I like how France and Belgium are listed like that because I know what it _means_ but in my mind we're burning bits of Europe for electricity Is it a sad ending (as in, does something horrendous happen to the octopus?)

Thanks for the explanation. I appreciate Agile’s cheaper in the long run (and can prove it thanks to your API data). But those prices for today are scary! 😧 はあ最高 And therein lies a fundamental issue. You need to retain baseline generation for when these renewables aren't there. Batteries are not sufficient for these load requirements If you can dodge the peak around 4pm to 8pm. The bill will be a lot less ハルちゃんがblだと、、🙏 Probably he is an octopus but why they named him SQUIDWARD tho 分かってますね（笑）* sees bastala playing with an octopus* It was like seeing an old energy bill come through.

A beautiful book about dogs and death (spoiler:dog dies but it is sensitively done so no triggers) is Lily and the Octopus. Have you read it? I'd recommend!Want ko nung reversible octopus😍😅 The CfD that SSE has for the Beatrice wind farm at Caithness would have required them to pay to generate during one of the peaks last week, so they switched it off. I agree with your comment in principle, but not always in practice. Also due to high outgoing rates I have set my inverter up to export from 4:30 to 6:30 pm thus supporting the local grid. This is what V2G will eventually be like. We will see the ramifications like an octopus that we will have surprises! ありがとー ありがとーwwEven though the octopus and humans diverged evolutionarily almost half a billion years ago (from a crude worm-like ocean creature), their eyes are remarkably similar to ours. Only bigger, mostly colorblind, panoramic, and able to see polarized light. wwwwwI want a reversible octopus さみしすぎてw You can't configure it to not appear on pages where new customers are trying to sign up? That's extraordinary. uai achei q c nn gostava mais kkk 🤡 Your telemarketers are very persistent and very rude for a company that I have never had any dealings with or given my contact details to. OK thanks for that, some highly venomous creatures in Australia, always thought a blue ringed octopus bite was lethal, but just googled that and not necessarily. Brown snake or Taipan you'd be stuffed without anti-venom? Enlighten me as to what he done wrong against Aberdeen? The defence was as comfortable as I’ve seen them this season against the sheep so I think your talking pish about that and bad management by playing him last night. He wasn’t the best last night but the crystal ball failed! Definitely ocean with mermaid, jellyfish, dolphin, octopus, tropical fish, shark seahorse, crabAnlaa ang cute nung octopus na na ba baliktad HAHAHAHHAAH Glad to hear it. Just make the cuddly toy sustainable and plastic free, that’s all I’m asking.hi gusto ko ng reversible octopus plushie baka naman may magregalo sa akin dyan,, bless ü 😘💞🐙 Haha ik bedoel ook juist dat ik het knap vind. 😁 wie verwacht een octopus van een 2 jarige. 😊The Pumpkin Tide "The Octopus Frontier" published 1960 later collected in "The Pill versus The Springhill Mine Disaster" (1968)I was so waved yesterday, watched My Octopus Teacher and shit was a rollercoaster.

Ik ga goed op het octopus knuffeltjr どめと同じ動きをするかはわからんがおるぞ どっか食いいく？ Getting to Mars ain’t cheep, maybe fans get discount?i also want that octopus stuff toy 銀座よし田そば、かな？ Yes putting in PV and batteries is very much a heart over head decision! But with battery prices lower than a kwh I fail to understand why Tesla batteries are so hugely expensive! But if people are happy to pay such prices then will continue to keep prices high! I’m glad to hear that and I’m not criticising you, please believe me. But we are in a climate disaster right now and fossil fuels are largely to blame. If covid wasn’t bad enough, we’re now starting to see regular catastrophic weather events too. We must stop using fossil fuels.where to buy the 2-mood octopus It would be great to see DSR incentives for households to reduce use below baseline and provide negawatts to the grid and be paid too. I think that can really get the masses on board and avoid the damaging impacts of the disincentive of really high prices.i want a reversible octopus •́︿•̀ ドアを開けて〜🎶₍₍ (ง ˙ω˙)ว ⁾⁾ ありがとうございます😊 タコ太くんもどうぞお気を付けて！ お疲れ様でした☃️ ヽ(*´∀｀)ノ For some reason Geto is very aesthetically pleasing with long wiggly horror creatures... octopus, caterpillars, eels? You need to hang in with Agile. The swings well outweigh the roundabouts over the months and it has saved me hundreds of £s. Octopus plants... Why do I kill them all My daughter has autism , and wanted this toy. She now has it and is over the moon. thread is full of hysteria false information. No they are not all getting octopus. I dont know any poor kid who would want octopus. Read the posts from those in private schools they are not getting whats in those pics. Plus if u pay more money u get better things. Capitalism101 This octopus don't wear no corpo tie, especially one that would be casual full time "Monday to Friday" lol (shocked it took IGN this long tbh) Thanks Sophia!I could never beat the Spider-Man 2 game because Doctor Octopus was too tough for me. Same story with the first game and Scorpion.excited nako sa pagdating ng octopus reversible kooo🥺😍 No I’m not saying that. I’m saying that octopus energy shouldn’t be giving away plastic toys, there are much better alternatives which don’t damage our planet and our health. After all they are sustainable energy company. Yes it probably is made of plastic, most cuddly toys are. "Octopus Paul" the Beast you are giving all the spoilers, did you forget that's my job!💓💓reversible octopus cutie!! 😭❤️ So are kids not expected to have cuddly toys anymore? It’s not even plastic... I don’t want to sound like a grinch, but isn’t it time you stopped giving away plastic toys? How about a subscription to a wildlife organisation, or a book. Far more useful and a lot less damaging to the planet. After all aren’t cuddly toys made from fossil fuels?I'd bring back proper old school rubber octopus Daleks by 9.30am on day one, no CGI here, no ma'am. By about lunchtime I'd insist that I'd only participate in meetings via the medium of rubber Dalek going forward. The cost equation for microgeneration was (for me, at least) break even over 20 years. Current pricing certainly changes the equation I’ll have to revisit the calculations. Not relishing the battle with planning authorities to get even a few solar panels installed on the roof☹️No but seriously I can't stop thinking about that. The girl had a point. I still think many buttcheeks is the better option for an octopus. But again what's an octopus gonna do with many buttcheeks when the job can be done with one pair only 🤔 Just renewed my Go Faster for another year. Very happy with it. mine. no baby octopus :3 I did a very cursory analysis at batteries and they seemed to payback just as you reached their end of life 10years. I’m on the v2g trial, fully agree that car batteries are a great option right now. If I had the cash I’d probably put a battery in coz I like tech and it’s fun! Octopus 🐙and to ppl who say "it's just a kink" "both of them are consenting" "she does it for shocking" no. even though both of them are consenting she normalizes rape. yes she did the octopus and egg videos for shock but considering her fanbase, this normalizes rape to some men 😂😂😂😂😁😀. Octopus Peterperspeptive is an octopus wearing one glove on five of its tentacles like fingers. makes sense in a sense, but also makes u wonder bout those other three tentacles 🐙I just recieved a late Christmas present of the reversible octopus I have legit wanted one for so long😁 This was probs one of the best Christmasses for me🥰 lol but like there’s a git command called octopus and I think you know what cat is Octopus vs Spiderman dans Spiderman PS4 InsomniacNot a big fan of using twitter but seem to be ignoring me. Since joining Agile in September of 50% of the time my Smets2 meter has not sent data to Octopus. Emails and phone calls are seem to be ignored. Can someone help!!!!!!!!!Mood: Do Octopus Dance Tiny octopus No definitely not Octopus fault. Take the rough with the smooth and review after a year. So far I am easily beating my previous suppliers prices. 間違いない😂 ブラックから更にブラックに行っちゃった笑 Согл 냄시 욱욱 La partie ''Octopus'' permet de gérer ce que tu recherches If I had V2G support, I can charge for free locally... I'm just wrapping up one of my daughters ready to pay the Octopus fees for today. (I don't blame for a moment the stars that are the Octopus Team!)Yay im going to create an octopus bc they will debut in the Many businesses and large public sector organisations do have backup generators, which they bid into the capacity market and will fire up during very high price periods/triad periods. It's a way of getting some money back on their investment which would otherwise just be idle. Owemjiiii.same store!!!!! Bwct na takoyaki yan 'di ko mawari kung octopus o butiki ang inilagay! Hzhzhzhzhhzhz I did a big financial analysis on spending £9000 on adding a powerwall to time share agile or GO energy and the sums just do not add up! When 0ctopus get their V2C system working then thats when we really start to win. Why pay twice for batteries? Yes, di ko nagustuhan yunh noon sa harmony mall tapos ngayon nalang me nakakain from food panda grabe yung octopus combo! Juicy! リアルに笑えないww Right I try not to swear on here but what the actual eff?!? That’s absolutely disgusting and this is making me livid. One rule for one has never been more apparent. Also, which kid eats octopus???? Odd that after all that they don't actually show the octopus giving up the cup of it's own accord Octopus teacher わたしもさっきまで知りませんでしたー！(ﾟﾛﾟ) うっかり恵方巻き食べ損ねるとこでした…！ Octopus or what 😂😂😂 for 10k? Actually had change of plan. Took brother in law to Leicester hospital. Now charging up for free at Tesco while waiting for him to see specialist. One way to beat current agile prices🤣🤣usto ko nung reversible octopus hahaha I jumped to octopus go yesterday. I’ve have been on agile since May buy comparing the two tariffs the other day agile was £2.45 more expensive.I want the inverted octopus :( Absolutely fair points. I would bin Smith and Butcher though. Have you watched My Octopus teacher on Netflix? If you haven't I highly recommend! U no see octopus wife before herhnn?Anyway like Fujimoto was on something with that fucking octopus devil. There was some explanation for some of it that Norway were turning on a link to a grid operated in Germany or something. Usually it's great, other energy providers wanted ~1500 nok (~£125) a month, unlimited but our electric bills march to October were ~£30-45 each I had thought it might be the import cables and pipes that have been shut down due to some Brexit red tape... Hopefully not . Would also make people more aware of what they are using and the associated cost. Needs to be aware of thoughDoes the octopus have no power anywhere? Any country, island? I think if things don't improve there will be a surge in requirement for solar/battery installs and more microgeneration. The government could reform the market by requiring smart meters and agile pricing but it would need to balance that with huge subsidized installation But they can keep 5Million subs dude octopus alive, its pathetic system But will you ever be able to be slapped by an octopus? Yes I have that app. I understand the general principles but the weather is warmer than for the past couple of weeks, and suddenly we're maxing out all day. Has a base load station gone down for maintenance?Soo his name is atiba which is my favorite footballer (we call him octopus) he's gonna be here a lot 💙 do you want to eat the octopus 😊So jealous of your solar/battery setup...if the energy market keeps this crazy push in energy prices, I’m going have to get something installed 아저씨 입냄새나요흐헤헤 Why only once lol , TOU is completely different.....Not big on any movie or doco that involves under water diving as it triggers my fear of drowning reaction but I did just watch My Octopus Teacher and I loved, loved, loved it. 🐙💜 Interesting. It must be a wider issue then... A lack of energy across the continent 😕🤷‍♂️ Also it's amazing that these kind of tariffs are gaining popularity 😍 We also do our best to move usage out of peak times. A bit tricky today though as peak seems to be 10am to 9pm 😔enjoy watching an octopus punch a fish 🐙🤜🐟 How in the world did I never realize the tail is an octopus arm until this very moment.After 10 years of Eco 20:20 - 22:00 to 8:00 off peak, 8 months of Agile, I'm finding from 20:30 much better as I can run the utilities while I'm awake OK OK - can you turn off the unnecessary messages about my battery level and carbon whilst I'm trying to fill in your forms please? got human octopus on my mind 😍 ブックオフでたまたま見つけたんじゃい！ はい？？？(突然の右京さん)want ko ng octopus na reversible 🥺🥰🥺🥰🥺🥰 another day without my refund being paid!! ありがとww 知らんwww It also seem logical to me that hospitals and other large urban electricity / heat users should use renewables and heat pumps most of the time, but have CHP units running from piped gas ready to supply both local heat demand and additional electricity at times like this. Thought he was comfortable v Aberdeen tbh I hate our lack of composure at the back so important he plays esp at home Wasn’t brilliant last night but as you say he’s only a kid I want octopus pet 🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙i wonder what azul’s reaction was when he found out the tweels’ fave foods involve octopus... like how do u feel knowing ur friends fave food is YOU 😭 It's almost as if all the wind and solar has been wiped out...

I would love to see all new cars being fitted with 2 way 240v inverters by default in a few years, allowing them to support the grid by default in situations like this. I’m sure octopus ink was used in the past I called your call centre on Monday as we've moved into a new property to give the previous owners meter reading but still no call back, was told I'd get a call back but still nothing! I'm thinking if Octopus. Dooes it give daily average patterns over several months... Eg winter, spring etc? Cold weather, lack of sun, lack of wind all contributing to tight margins meaning we are probably importing more energy than normal and running expensive back up power generation. I’ve been asking the same questions and that’s what I’ve learnt anyway. I found this app helpful. So you would gangbang an octopus?304.

The subset of Octopus Agile customers (and those who understand what Agile is and why it exists) is not very representative of mass market, IMHO. Clearly there's a decent size market for it, but suspect most don't care. 😂😂😂 Someone who puts googly eyes on a dead octopus too😟 おめでとう!!🎉 誰かに蹴られたの？ ホントニネー Many thanks, had an email already! While I think we've done everything we can do, and I try to take the long view (this is just a blip) I wish our Powerwall was more tightly in tune with our Agile tariff.Gonna buy reversible octopus bila masuk hanyang We are on a similar platform called Tibber here and the last week or so have had huge spikes where the cost for energy has been 3x what it should be.

I chose starting at 11:30pm I'm a bald grey octopus Cleaning up the cable octopus on the back of the computer. But that’s a different type of zip tie. These were clearly flexcuffs, which flight attendants use to restrain looney passengers, and cops use to restrain... ahem, people when they have too many to use handcuffs on. GO Faster gives you 4.5p/kWh for 3hrs rather than 5p/kWh for 4 hours just switched last week.

Lols 😂 Iya kak coba aja cari boneka octopus atau reversible octopus 😂 True, but I think a years set of data is the fairest comparison rather than any given week or month, generally you don’t switch tariffs more than once a year I reverted to GO a few days ago. There's some nuclear off and brexit has screwed with imports. Combined with cold cloudy low wind days pushes the price up. で、なにがあったん Lu looked up at them and nodded and leaned into Pride and the reached for his octopus stuffed animal. meron na kaya sa shopi 😳😳 the octopus chose violence 😄 My Octopus Teacher on Netflix is (gently) uplifting should bring the heart rate right down.there’s a species of octopus called adorabilis i’m crying 멋져요멋져!!!!!😚😚 マリカーとテニスとスマブラで夜明かしした身、コントローラはあれ。これは実質ゲームキューブ！ Im not crying here, just wondering what's going on with the agile prices. search mo “reversible octopus” tas magpakasawa ka 세상에 열심히 달리구 계시고만요!!! 네이버에서 한번 찾아보도 햇엉8 I love the octopus dice 😁 i would loooove ocean themed pets! like a seahorse, octopus, shark, fish, dolphine or whatever! that would be awsome! or like small pets, like hamsters!

Have told the family to avoid tumble drying today. Not very impressed with Agile after a month. Anyone know why rates are at or close to the cap all day today? It seems to be a shortage of renewable power on the grid. Agile feed-in customers have reported being offered £1.50 per kWh at times today. Looking at my regional energy mix yesterday we're over 75% from coal and gas 😔osamu whispering the small "shh shh" to rin when he's tossing in his sleep and rin always wraps his arms around osamu like an octopus, osamu kisses his head and they both fall asleep.
