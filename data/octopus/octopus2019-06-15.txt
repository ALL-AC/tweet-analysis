WHO CARES IF HE NEEDS IT.Joe YOU were an OCTOpus Printing a custom deck of cards 😋 "I'M NOT DOCTOR OCTOPUS! Good save Otto." Oh. Dear. God. No. each unique icon should be treated as its own variable. there is no clear indication in the first three lines that [two octopuses icon] = 2*[one octopus icon]. 10 + 5 * 10 = 10 + (5*10) = 60 multiplication happens before addition in the order of operations hmmm. what about looking for buttons/jewellery notions instead of plastic? surely there has to be some good beetles out there to balance the millions of steampunk octopus pendants... I'd rather eat chicken strips than octopus anyday The octopus has to worth ten. Two of them = 20, and they're the same variable. RIght? Has to be 10 each. Also, there's a times sign in the last line, so it's 10 + 5 X 10 = 150. (Right?) So sorry was unable to join you all this evening. Memories in abundance, and looking forward to next adventures.

Yes we use less than 50%, more like 25-30% used on site but we want to add measures to increase that significantly. Depends on your usage.... the original FIT export part is deemed 50% regardless of what you use. So if you use more than 50% of what you generate you might be better off sticking put. But if you're a low % user, maybe could be worth it? Again, needs for some self-working out! 🤜 That is Superior Spider-Man I believe. When Doctor Octopus becomes Spider-Man. 🕷🐙 That’s interesting to know! We have PV already, I wonder if it’s worth switching from our existing export tariff. Some octopus stuff. But it was definitely coming. Fucking an octopus is much better. Gorilla glue. You draw lots of wee circles of glue, and then stick it. The circles act like the tentacles of an octopus. The 365 day data is particularly interesting 👍 Presumably the Agile Outgoing tariff means you have also be on Agile when buying elec? I would like a good review of Agile Outgoing.

Or was I that drunk all weekend and making it up? 😂 I'm crying omg the lil octopus Thanks Glyn. I'm glad folk are finding it useful. It's just a little homebrew website project to satisfy my own geekery! I'm hoping to add their new Agile Outgoing tariff next for Solar exports back to the grid. Not enough information. Line 3's double octopus = 20, but line 4 uses a single octopus image, which hasn't been defined. if it = 10, ? = 60. If it was a typo and = 20, ? = 110. That’s is very interesting. I now have some storage batteries and have been considering the Agile tariff. But charging 2x EV’s overnight still weighs toward Go.... must do some more analysis and maybe use the batteries to store solar excess output. though salmon seems to be the most popular today, the classic poke is still raw Ahi tuna or cured octopus, known as he’e in Hawaii.「oct」は「８」という意味です。タコはoctopus（8本足） オクターブはドレミ〜ラシの8つの音だからoctave。あれあれ⁉でもoctoberは10月、8なのに10だよ⁉実はむかしのヨーロッパでは3月が一年の始まりだったから、3月から数えて8番目の月がoctoberになったんですね（≧∇≦） I might be getting an octopus tattoo on Friday.Octopus in garlic flavored oil with hot sauce  Hi Taylor, we swapped to Octopus Energy 2 years ago and think they're great.
