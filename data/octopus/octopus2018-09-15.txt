Yes and “drunk octopus wants to fight” is an actual lyric in that song so I love it more. I really want to talk about that song omg.

Don’t get me wrong I’m all for saving the planet etc but electric vehicles aren’t the huge earth savers they are made out to be I mean the UKs target is to generate 30% of it’s electricity by 2020....so 70% comes from non renewable sources which are the ones causing the problems. That’s a huge difference Ok let’s forget our little country a second here which is smaller than some states in the US, the US as a whole gets 81% if it’s energy from fossil fuels. As for the 39.8% add nuclear into that and we are beyond a majorityWhenever I see the headlines on Twitter that is something regarding Japan, it's either about weather, research, or something weird like a psychic octopus was made into sushi.Is it not octopi?
