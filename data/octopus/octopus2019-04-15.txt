"Imitation" Не всегда понимают формальные законы, которые заставляют объект их изучения работать именно так. Научный/инженерный/технический подход возможен примерно к любой «гуманитарной» области, и почти всегда такой подход выигрышен по сравнению с наивными подходами гуманитариев. "I KNOW! Silly. That other one is only for squid, octopus, cucumber, carrots, eggplant, celery fish sticks, oysters, tortillas, baguettes, hotdog buns, and clams!" Synonims for basically just 2 things. Haha, Betty is spoilt. Whenever her dad, Captain Octopus, comes on the show my lad shouts ‘Daddy’ Where would I find an octopus to wrestle Так сосут же.

I’ve also downloaded the OctoWatchdog app. It’s 99p but makes it all a bit easier - Octopus app isn’t that great, at the moment.

So like . . . what if I got a pet octopus? 🤔 Ебать. Без гуманитариев (юристов етц.) не будет ни денег, ни власти. Понимание имеет первостепенную роль, когда речь идёт об этих двух. Твои документы должны быть составлены с минимумом дыр, но ты сам должен уметь в свою пользу интерпретировать законы и документы других игроков.

Ты зачем-то смешал лингвистику и её применения. Если так рассуждать, то компьютерная наука — гуманитарщина, т. к. фотошопом пользуются дЕСиГнЕры. I think so? It is an octopus furnace. Replaced I believe the thermocoupler a few years ago but they said at that time no need to do anything else. Then continue with your comparison. As long as DL is immune, have at’em. 1.

Hi Nichola- Molly is indeed fantastic, as was Maddie who spotted your concern so Molly could jump on it. No company is perfect but I‘m really proud of the team because they’ll do anything to put errors right. Sorry for the initial mistakes but thanks for being quick to praise too Ну и само-то применение — полностью гуманитарное офк. Но без работы лингвистов ни о каких политиках речи быть не может. В худшем случае всё так. В лучшем — политика должна вести язык к уменьшению неоднозначностей любого рода. (В первую очередь это важно для юридических документов, которые в идеале должны иметь одну и только одну интерпретацию.)Octopus definitely has the highest 'guilt/delicious' ratio of all the foods. I love it too. I have become a little obsessed though! Can wait to combine it all with the export tariff when I get the solar 👍 I appreciate that Dr Jones was the easy reach but I’m a little infuriated that you didn’t go for the music video that is basically Aquaman.Today absolutley sucked Octopus Dick. Wow Ну да, она гуманитарий. Но она и не лингвист, она — ИЗДЕЛИЕ лингвистики, если так хочешь. Без лингвистов она не изучила бы язык, у неё не было бы под рукой словарей и справочников, памяти перевочика, спеллчекера, проверки грамматики. Definitely think you’re in the minority on this issue. But it’s your opinion to have. No one gets hurt from this. Players and fans love it. But in my opinion If you manage to get a catfish or an octopus into the arena you’ve earned the right to throw it As will the increase in energy Bill's. Mine has gone up 50% in 4 yrs. As will the fear and reality of power outages and brown outs. As will the continuous news regarding the environment. These are the reasons ppl buy solar. Ладно, давай закончим на том, что раз уж нам не повезло жить в мире людей и не иметь возможности передавать мысли друг другу через libastral, лингвистика важна для того, чтобы люди могли ОДНОЗНАЧНО и ЛЕГКО понимать друг друга.I asked my new intern what kind of food he liked so we can take him out to lunch tomorrow and he was like "I ate river snail, raw horse meat, and octopus burgers in Japan so I don't care, just no spicy please" and i was like, damn.

I may have to get Big Odell Octopus tomorrow... Еп, но писал какую-то чушь про прикладные дисциплины. Looking forward to report back on this. Ахем, ты просил ПРИМЕНЕНИЯ лингвистики — я их привёл. Я не говорил, что никакие вопросы, кроме прикладных лингвистика не изучает. Я не говорил, что на лингвистике всё завязано, лол. Я всего лишь хочу сказать, что она столь же гумантирна, насколько гуманитарна физиология или химия. Да, она намного менее фундаментальна, чем математика и физика, но от этого ничуть не менее точна и научна. Ah yes.... The Titanic movies. The other kids movie where everyone dies but the main characters survive so it's cool and the one where the giant octopus saves the Titanic and it never even sinks. True masterpieces in cinema history ea party ki eni seats vastayi in ap elections tell me octopus 🐙 おはぱいそんさん！ Ты вообще все понятия в кучу спешал, лол. Гуманитарными, офк.

Ten-Tickles I sold as much in 2008/9 and 10 as i did when FiTs started and not stopped since. No I’m delighted to hear your business is still doing well! But I personally know a lot of people whose renewables businesses failed because of chopping and changing the policy regime, which I think deserves to be criticised by opposition politicians. Agree to disagree on this The money to launch the scheme came from the CCL on peoples bills and via the £350,000 from the EU, The energy companies started collecting in 2008/09. All in labour years. With all due respect the numbers who would spend thousands just for those reasons are very limited. The vast majority of people are primarily interested in finances, which explains why installation numbers increased as soon as the FiT was introduced. I tell you what, I'll write my own P45 out today shall I? I know! That’s where this thread began, remember? The Tory’s genius contribution was to choose to pay for the FITs out of energy bill levies. who designed the original policy for Labour always intended for it to be paid for through general taxation An octopus could be hiding right under your nose, AND YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT... What’s changed is investment has UK solar investment has crashed and the pipeline dwindled to a trickle, just at the point when govt should be procuring huge volumes of now-much-cheaper solar power. Long term revenue certainty lowers cost of capital and makes everything cheaperOctopus lovers are broken hearted  The FIts were introduced by Ed Milliband, April 1st 2010 before the coalition government came in. We were the last of the then 27 EU member states top introduce our Clean Energy Cask Back Scheme., It wasn't a Tory idea. OK, let me be clear. I sold solar before FiTs to people who were concerned about 1) Climate Change 2) The Russians turning the gas pipes off 3) Crap interest Rates 4) Rising energy costs 5) Security / Resilience What's changed, other than everything being around 75% cheaper? I've heard of such schemes in France and elsewhere worldwide, but I think they are generally trial sites rather than commercial developments. The additional cost of amending the solar system to allow arable agriculture is a challenge. Many current solar farms allow sheep grazing. That's good too. This story is the story of the same person in the parallel world. The fight is about to start because a blonde man declared that he would monopolize the octopus girl. There is absolutely no reason the govt couldn’t procure volumes of solar and require energy companies to purchase it! The whole UK electricity market is a regulatory construct. Nobody *has* to make low income households shoulder costs of energy transition, the tories *chose* toAbysser seeing Nova testing his octopus (back up reg) and thinks how he can legitly borrow it underwater Probably an octopus with 72 tentacles. If you don't consider a cut of 75% to be drastic I'm not sure what is. Plus as it came as a shock to virtually the entire energy industry I'm sure with your massive foresight you were able to take advantage and make millions. Removal of long term revenue support for small scale solar is directly driving developers to pursue larger and larger ground mount schemes, like the 50MW+ one in Kent marsh wilderness, to make £££ numbers work. Btw this is such a weird convo to have with a solar company boss Even octopus has more strong spine than .....they lost the credibilityAlthough octopus is contained in octopus dumplings, the sea bream is not contained in the fish-shaped pancake filled with bean jam. Is there any experimentation in growing food in solar fields? Lots of salad greens grow in partial shade. Yes, Gov investment is where the real message is. In the US, the military bases lead that department. Solar may not be affordable to all, yet, but neither is a house or a car. But it should be the energy companies who pay us for export, not ppl who can not afford their own bills Planning generally only allows solar on poor quality farmland. Plus we would never reach 1% - much solar will be rooftop and it is so poor in the winter there will always be a significant proportion of annual generation from other sources such as wind. "Trying to dress Aurora is like arm wrestling an octopus." 🤣🤣🤣 Oh my word, how cute. Isn’t a blue Octopus poisonous when older? ❤️❤️❤️ Depends how much you get off on pretending to an octopus really Ok we’ll Produce 59% of our own food and get all of our electricity from domestic sources. A winning trade-off. Domestic installations were at a rate of about 2MW/week or 100MW/year. Such capacity would cost about £4million in annual FiT payments. That is approximately 0.0016p/kWh which for a domestic bill of 3500kWh is 5p/year. Green levies brought down bills 4 millions of poorer ppl, by investing in energy efficiency in poorer households. Fits made pv far more affordable for far more families. Win win. Govt must stop impeding industry with rates/CfD hurdles etc invest in solar across govt estate Glad it was a great stream! Thanks for raiding Octopi! You're awesome Nagi ❤ There’s more than one way to skin this cat though Kev! It was the tories that chose to fund FiTs out of levies on energy bills, and then said that was unfair and they’d have to get rid of FITs to stop energy bills rising! Just pay out of general taxation ffs I do, when we only produce 60% of our own food For what it's worth I think all such green subsidies should be paid out of general taxation but anyway the cost of continuing the FiT would have been completely insignificant. The domestic install FiT was at 3.79p/kWh, all I am suggesting was it was tapered to zero. 1/2 Drastic? How come I knew in October 2009 they would be introduced, cut after the first two years, according to deployment then re-addressed every yr thereafter as costs fell. Then the Coalition Gov changed it and we have quarterly cuts rather than annual. 36 or so in total Just 1% of farmland would produce 100% of U.K. electricity. I don’t see a problem here. I'm not denying that FiTs needed to be cut, what me and most others in the solar industry object to is the drastic way in which they are suddenly cut. The German market is one of the most dynamic rooftop solar markets in the world and that has had constant degression. £24,000 Fake Octopus! Go and mind your compound ooo correct. And FiTs bought a 4kw pv system down from 324000 to less than £6000 So why should single parents in tower blocks who can hardly pay their own bills, subsidise those who can afford solar? FiTs were a necessary evilhorseradish octopus melt crab rangoon. . .31 seaweed basket broth. . .9 white meat arepa, dumplings. . .21 baked winter squash pappardelle, broth. . .18 Before FiTs many solar installations benefitted from direct grants. The total number of installations per year before FiTs were also relatively insignificant so completely different to now. Then i suggest you look into HOW those installs came about. The FiTs over-inflated the market, done their job well be decrease the worldwide cost of solar. We were the 67th country to introduce a FiT and certainly not the first to cut them. I wasn't talking about large scale as in big individual projects, I was talking about scale as many more small projects. In 2014 and 2015 about 2000 domestic installs were happening a week, in early 2016 the FiT was cut drastically and numbers dwindled to about 500. The sales companies that start after fits were introduced will have find another way of selling. As all we've heard for 10 yrs is 'gov subsidies, when's my payback' Solar sold before Fits and was not invented in the 1880's to make money. They make energy. Large scale should be on the roofs of the factories and foundries that use the energy. Not fields. they are for food. That's the second time Ikea have pulled out. The fit cut in 2012 was the first time. Also, we refused their install contract twice over the years. Both times, the costs were so tight, we would have to do two a day within 10 miles to make it work financially. When the FiT was ended the rate for a typical domestic installation was 3.79p/kWh. For a typical installation 3.79p/kWh was about 25% of the total financial benefit of installing solar. Taking this all away at once will definitely impact deployment. Lack of scale also means that many manufacturers no longer concentrate on the GB market, if there was scale it is estimated costs could fall by another 20%. 2/2 Agree with this - the number of companies in the GB solar market and therefore competition has fallen greatly. Just last week the Ikea-Solarcentury joint venture announced it would stop as a result of the FiT cuts. 1/2 오와아!! 낙지얌 생일축하해😍💖 맛난거많이먹구 행복한 하루보내길 바랄께~❤💗💝👍 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 け、敬語の方がいいですか… 調べる限り大丈夫そやし大丈夫やろ！って感じ 後はなんてIDにするかやな Третья)) You got them hardcore FEELING FEELINGS Че ты этого пидора слушаешь?
