Pretty cool! ブロックされてる…… When he DOES get round to visiting, let me know what day so I can park my car there and block it ;p  This has happened so many times before... You don't remember my Paul the Octopus phase last world cup? Lol ひええぇぇ… 戦い切ったのね…！！ Yeah think it was 300+ vat installed with the tax credit. And you can get up to 20 installed at that price I'm on the lookout for a big electric which is also a motorway muncher, they do exist but so many ££££'s a diesel it is, for now at least. そうなのね…結構辛い感じなのかしら…？ あれ？なんで？ damn didnt know u dive. and damn... id cry, Octopus are my fave animal. ラグいだけじゃね I can name a few of my customers that have them as well. I’d love to know how it goes. Yeah a nice diesel motorway muncher and a small electric would be a great combo. As it's the next big fad businesses can get significant funding towards charge points. And councils are having to now do more to provide chargers for residents without driveways That's why I got rid of my diesel and went back to petrol. 😂😂😂😂😂 we couldn't get ours to even do cycle to work. As for the car park there be no chance of us getting that. Only 2 charge points for whole estate as the estate wants everyone to use public buses instead which don't run after 7pm again no good to me. 🥳🥳🥳 We almost bought a bmw i3 but have a 100m uphill drive so would have had to put a charge point at the end for the 3-4 weeks a year we need to leave our cars on the main road What I really want is a diesel hybrid but with all the diesel hate, I doubt they will be coming to market I need to actually! Later this month? We had one installed at the office for to come visit but he obviously doesn't like us that much as he hasn't been yet 😭😭😭😂Octopus has 9 brains but my best friend got none Sweet! Dude my buddies found an octopus the time i decided not to dive 他の業者より圧倒的にやすいと思いますよー！ Think my next car will be an EV or a high MPG petrol. Just can't afford a new car right now. If I had the money I'd buy a McLaren F1 LM. Anyone got a spare few million lying around? 😂 추카 ~ Yeah me too although I'm currently looking at electrics as it doesnt make sense for me to buy an ICE car any more as I have a driveway so I can charge. Pues es verdad. Además nosotros no solemos hacer largas distancias, que es donde se acusa más el tema de permeabilidad intestinal. 🤔🤔🤔 Quizás, simplemente sea de agitar y batir el cuerpo tan deprisa al correr. 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 Pero eso es más a largo plazo, eso creo que es a problema en la motilidad y cuando es muy exigente el entreno. Me suena más a disminución del flujo. Habrá que investigar jaja Smallish being 50 Miles as most new ones have over 100 Miles range? It's certainly getting easier. Not to also count in that some workplaces are getting EV chargers installed for staff. あ、自分イッちゃいましたw I drive a modern diesel as I live in the middle of nowhere at the top of a big hill. If I live in a city I'd buy a petrol instead. If I only have a smallish commute I'd buy an electric car Buy the car for your needs. End of argument. わかんないです笑 Love the octopus metaphor. Wonderful advice in this post. You cover much that’s slowing me down 🙂 your twitter has some of the most hilarious stories out there and I wish someone would make short comic strips out of it. Driving an ICE will cause far more deaths long term... они так быстро растут :' Actually China have made huge strides towards renewables recently. If you take into account the size of their population they are doing really well. Its the USA which is the problem as they are terrible and not getting better. ありがと〜！！！ 天井行かなくて一安心よ〜！！ 肉眼だともっと強く太く光ってたんだ〰️！短時間だったけど気づけてラッキーだった👍 SM: Wall climbing scene SM2: Doctor Octopus sacrificing himself SM3: Spider-man putting on the red suit in the end ASM: Lizard school fight ASM2: First few minutes of Spider-man in the city SMH: Peter leaving the dance and putting on his homemade suit ITSV: City mourning Peter Not to mention it takes almost as much electricity to refine and transport enough oil to drive a mile as it does for an electric car just to drive a mile straight from the electricity. if you were in Agile you could have had the lowest price per mile record. うぽありです！ うううん с боевым крещением тебя! :D ぱこぱこ You could always run 120 ele x varuna...that's what the yter i watched did and his dmg was p decent ö ideally youd run primal x primal tho octopus lady pls come home And my dad has a Jaguar XK8 V8 from 1998. 🙊The best science fiction also works as allegory.

That's a fact. arguably they're better in every way except milage already. However for a majority of people 150-200 miles range offered by most models is more than enough. Only a small percentage of people do 300+ miles a day. I think the average journey is under 10 each way. Just the most polluting. So you want to get rid of all cars then?«Octopus's Garden» Otis the octopus I had economy 7, recently changed to smart+Agile. Too early to say which is cheaper. PV, Two EVs, electric water heating and all appliances, so most use is off peak. When they can get an alternative car to run as good or even better to the current non ev cars then I will have another look. My first car could only do 300 miles a tank, now I can get 500-600 that's progress and maybe the same will happen to alternative powered vehicles. 楽しかったです〜(≧∀≦) やっぱり曲目が同じだろうと、行く価値はあるのだ！ と改めて確信できた夜でした✨ You did quite a few months ago and slagged me off for still driving a petrol car. Then not long after you posted about the issues you were having. I remember it well.Kadia the professor is a gold octopus If it stops moving after that would eat it. Have had octopus before and it is nice. I haven't once said you should go and buy an Electric Car now. I'm actually one of the few EV drivers that admits its not for everyone. And my car does what I need it to do fine as well. The reason I got it was with electric you get all the "toys" as standard. Plus I'm a geek, its fricken electric. Sure I have to charge to get to Scotland, however the hundreds of miles I do around town I never have to charge. idk why, but he looks like a baby octopus here My car hasn't broke and runs fine at 50mpg it has a small engine but I could have bought one with a nice powerful engine. It gets to speed limit and gets me to Scotland without having to stop to fill up or recharge. For what I need it for does me fine. What dream world? I never said I drove an EV for environmental reasons. It's got many other benefits that suit me. The original tweet was highlighting the fact that Hybrids are marketed as significantly better for the environment when they can only do around 5 Miles on Electric อยากเป็นท่าน แต่ก่อนมันจะเป็นท่านกรุจะเป็นบ้าก่อน I had some initial issues yes. However fixed them and it's been the best car I've owned. The first car I brought lost £2,000 in a year because the head gasket went and no one nearby wanted to fix it. I'll let you live in your dream world. Guess you be at the next extinction protest then if you care that much."Your long hair, octopus plushie in my lap" weird. Is that octopus with potato chips?? No but experience I have had of electric vehicles and seeing comments of the issues that ev owners like Ryan have had tells me to steer clear of them till a better technology like full kinetic come available. Bugger. I better not go and buy a steak either. Faster acceleration = more friction = more microscopic fibres for us all to breathe in fact. You should work as PR for the Koch brothers! 😂 Do you own stock in Oil Gas industry or something?So I’m in Portugal this week, which is awesome. But there’s a food craze here I just don’t get. Every restaurant serves octopus 🐙, and in So Many ways. I like calamari, but octopus 🐙 is way to rubbery for me. How ‘bout you? Extra points for your feelings about 🐙 in a gif.potent stuff addicts talk in dark music on a corner of tags reserved for dreamers they text text n time drips by you can see the anxiety build suddenly out of the woods sweat shines shivers in the sunlight parking on their side its n octopus of arms reaching out in exchanges Caring about the environment doesn't mean you have to live completely off grid! Same but the octopus is so cute. :/ How does it. When the post office comes to you daily what vehicle are they in? A diesel by chance? You still use them don't you? Petrol and diesel will still be here for many years. Electric cars are also more dangerous in a serious accident as they can burn for days. Not at all. They say they are more efficient which is true. Fossil fuel production causes far more damage than battery production. That's indisputable. It's not a miracle cure. But its substantially better. One factor often forgotten is that batteries can then be reused after. There's an awful lot to go into the complexities behind it such as being able to then re-use the batteries after not suitable for EVs for solar storage. Farzi Octopus attention Tracey Adams. There is a whale entangled in octopus trap off Clovelly corner, false bay. Devastating after you joined us this morning. 7-13 on keyboard 😂😂. Ngl, it's kinda enjoyable to play on keyboard, but it's also a torture for your hands, cause key mapping is horrible and you basically have to be an octopus. Really? I would have thought squid or an octopus. Crinoids seem so harmless vaguely floral.Ive always low key believed those giant octopus/sea creature mariner stories from antiquity. There are too many for them all to be made up. Wasnt no communication back then so how would they copy stories This is it they are marketed as green. But damage is done making them. Vast land ruined by mining for the materials to make the batteries. It still needs oils and gases to produce "some" of the electric. It's just the car producers have done a great job hiding this to the buyer As Tesco says - every little helps 😁5:00am: Black Moth Super Rainbow The Octopus Project—Runite Castles—The House of Apples Eyeballs I don't speed, (I'm actually quite obsessive not to go over) but the acceleration is faster and can be fun at times. And sure, my cruise control and reversing camera sensors make me more dangerous? It's funny also that here you are effectively making the point that we don't use as much fossil fuel power as before.... Which makes your argument about electric cars even weaker 😂This day in 2004, Dr. Octopus met Spidey* on the big screen... SEEN-IT: "Arachnid man slays six-arm villain, luv." In my area agile prices dropped to 1.26p/kWh last night, I'm in the progress of switching to Octopus and the Go tariff but will be running the numbers through the Agile's pricing once I have some usage data to work with. しっかりして〜((ヾ(இдஇ; ) 地道に集めて頑張ろ!☺️(私もっ ah okii, nag syota pala ako ng octopus It has toys🤔 so not only have you admitted to speeding but your admitting to not giving your full attention to the road as you playing with toys in your car. Thanks I feel so safe knowing I'm sharing the road with idiots who play with toys. Love big engines, love sweetly tuned exhausts, love cars in general, will be sad when ICE cars inevitably die out. But it is indisputable that electric cars are more efficient and less polluting throughout their life cycle. I'm not tough. Otherwise I would be a Vegan. I drive an EV because it's fun, has all the toys and is cool. Ursula is BLACK??? Since when?? She’s an octopus. If you were all so worried about the environment both of you wouldn't be ordering stock to sell from China. You aren't though. Follow the money Also, at the wheel (not including generation of electricity) EVs are about 3 times more efficient. Even a coal power plant is ~35% efficient so the EV is still *at worst* as efficient as an ICE. And at best far far more efficient. Gas power plants about 50 to 60% efficient«Octopus's Garden» If you look at your energy statement or provider you'll see a breakdown of what actual electric your provider paid for. Despite the UK doing more renewables. Your provider would have sourced significantly more from likely Gas compared to renewables. At the end of the day. Ursula isn't a human. She is a purple octopus. I don't think it matters what color the person who plays her is.Naagin ,🐍 billi 🐱 ,,, ek sath octopus 🐙 😁😁😁😁 But I'm using renewalable energy without having to pay for it. The UK last month did a record month without using coal surviving off wind, solar, water, gas.If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, Thank you! Yes but if your provider only pays renewable companies then there's more renewables in the grid. Maybe the electricity isn't used exclusively by you but it has the same net effect on emissions Kinetic energy is the future, colbalt can only be mined for so long just like oil. Neither ev or oil based cars can be substained fact. Both have advantages both disadvantages. But I would research how a ev battery is made and look at the damage caused."What They Found" by The Octopus Project (☆´ิ罒´ิ)ﾆﾔ Yes but assuming x amount is paid to go in and x amount is paid to go out then the generation you are paying for is renewable. Faster acceleration. And well there's less break dust as it uses the engine. EVs are the future, you can either embrace and enjoy the technology. Or you can just deny they have no benefits at all and ignore it. Your choice. 二万だぞ？ こら!!!!さらに誤解をうむような発言しないで～(T_T) is the best factual tv show ever. Mind blowing is an understatement. I always knew there was something special about them.  あー、だから警官見てドキドキ してたんやな🤔？www 持ってなーーーーーい!!!!(笑) そして、よくよく考えたら嫁に行ってたわ娘(笑) I don't care how many Gaia coins or signed dollars you wager me, I am NOT surfing an octopus's timeline ever again! I woke up and had to count my appendages, messed me up! For a microsecond I thought I was still an octopus, it was disconcerting. But you can't tell where your electric has come from. Your whole street is on the same electric no matter who your provider is unless your provider has duf up the street to lay their own cable to your house. It's just you billed by a different company. あはははははは(*≧▽≦) そうそう、娘さん！ いつもいっしょやん！ Shame they can't respond to their dms! ちがーーーう(笑)So if octopuses' tentacles have their own independent sub-brains and aren't under the conscious control of the octopus, how do mimic octopuses form themselves into specific shapes? What if each tentacle wants to do a different animal? How's it faster? Are you admitting to speeding? Faster acceleration means more pollution on any car as microscopic fibres break off into the air for everyone to breath in. If you going faster I guess you need to brake harder and more microscopic particles for everyone to breathe That's not how the energy market works in the UK. Energy companies pay generation companies to feed into the national grid who work simply as a connector and mediator in case a power station fails or is halfway across the country from where electricity is needed. But most importantly, my cars faster than yours so :P げんこつ位の唐揚げ美味しくていいよね わ～～い！！他のキャラも楽しみにしています…！！！！(❁ᴗ͈ˬᴗ͈)) ほとむさん、お目目が格好良いので大王とかも似合いそうですね☺️💜✨ ほとむさんいつも沢山褒めてくれるのでとても有難いです😭😭😭💞本当にありがとうございます…！！！ Technically yes. However the energy they purchase is renewable. So they source renewable energy for every unit their customers use. Furthermore because of my EV tarrif I charge at night. Which is usually significantly lower carbon on the national grid due to demand. ナイスやろ?????(笑) Yo de digestión voy bien pero hay algunos días como aprieto demás en un entreno fuerte, me descompongo literalmente y unos gases terribles!!!!!!. Supongo que será al disminuir el flujo sanguíneo en el estómago. Y es raro porque hacía más de 10horas q comí. Electric in the UK is moved around via the electric network, none of us know where exactly it was produced. There is also no way octopus have laid the millions of miles of cables, pylons etc to get electric to you, unless they would like to show this. Except, I get all my electric from on a Renewable Tarrif so the electric I use to charge my car is essentially green. Furthermore most comparisons don't include the pollutants required to transport petrol to petrol stations first in comparison. ｢ちぇっ( ・ε・)｣ ｢いやいやいや😅｣ 私、CDって言ったよ～(^_^;)？？ Mis digestiones son buenas. Pero sí quiero mejorar aún más para llevar buenas sensaciones en los entrenamientos. Y no estresar tanto al estómago y al cuerpo. Ya con aumentar los entreno de calidad...
