Went and looked it up in my favourite search engines... I'm just asking how you currently heat your home, here in Essex not in Rotterdam. zahra the flirter jellyfish octopus and fish for u 🤯 Why? Do you know what Rotterdam is doing? Rotterdam appears (I have only glanced at this) to be tentatively testing DH on 1% of its dense 900k population... Even the gas (and cable) network doesn't reach all corners of the UK... Octopus pakore sounds like a good place to start coral octopus omg i really love your editssss MORRA REVERSIBLE OCTOPUS, MORRA IMEDIATAMENTE Hello! We recently switched to Octopus- everything went well. What happens with the Smart Meter which was installed by our previous supplier? So electric heating? Or gas? Thanks! I am with Octopus in a terraced house not far from big energy producers and users. We need to do precisely what Rotterdam is doing nowOriginally my MCU theory was that Knull would be the big bad (Spiderman 3 having Venom, Thor 4 having Gorr) but sadly it seems I'm wrong, but good news is we're getting Doctor Octopus and Electro! We've had them several times so I wonder what that's going to be like.  New DH infrastructure is expensive and a natural monopoly. DH is probably good for 10% of UK space heat but our existing DH networks are often pretty poor. I'd rather replace gas pipes with DH than switch them to H2, and something has to happen, but coordination also hard. Spiders have 8 legs and an octopus has 7..the other is his pee pee 😂 Amazing, but I don't think I'll experiment with the octopus way. octopus and coral lets be bestie ♡ How do you heat your home Clive? Will you be organising a local heat network for your street? It would be great to see if that could be made to happen. hiya, we got a smart meter installed on Monday, only the electric icon was showing on the screen not the blue gas icon, the engineer advised to wait 48 hours and if it doesn’t show up to get in contact, it’s still not showing up please could I get help with this☺️ Basically Offen only allowed exemption from tariff lid to 3 green electricity companies, in recognition of their bona fides.

Because they are fixated on individuals their business plans have not recognised what bringing together existing fuel bills cooperatively can achievegusto ko na magpagupit pota mukhang octopus na yung buhok ko 😭😭 As far as I understand it cable providers are still under a mountain of debt for those wires, and wires are a great deal easlier to install (and higher value commercially) than fat pipes for heat. could why are you not rolling out heat mains as Virgin did broadband?
