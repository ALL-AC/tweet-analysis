When I explained it needed petrol they were visibly disappointed An octopus having a fight with itself in a phone box..😳 ムゲンとシーフー衣装が公式であるのでそれを買って、ロジュシャオヘイ作れば一応何があっても「囲める」かなって思いまして………て……🥺 見学だけなら確かに…！そっと見学してそっと帰りたい（Absurdly a mongoose is not as smart as an octopus.

Finally got my copy this week Edd - the tahini choc chip cookie bars are on the list for today...but got to go cycling with fam first! It all looks fab, can't wait to get baking 💕 The phrase we have a problem with is "self-charging", so it's very to do with how the battery is charged. The car gets its energy from only one source: the petrol you put into it. i honestly didn’t even know they made any takoyaki without octopus 😂What did the Octopus evolve from? Being facetious about the term ‘self charging’ doesn’t make you right. I saw him on Al Murray’s quiz, he is a great quizzer! The jellyfish and octopus are everything!! If your friends required to be educated in the subject they clearly have no idea what the term ‘Hybrid’ meant. Nothing to do with the way the battery is charged. WTF is going on above his pants? Why does it look like a baby octopus is trying to escape? Moved into new house and had letter waiting; saying £25 credit if I signed up online etc - did so; never received credit. Also; your tariff is 2.5ppkwh more expensive than SSE.A baby octopus is about the size of a flea when it is born.  Absolute nonsense. It’s not just a hybrid with extra marketing words. One is a *plug in. You HAVE to ‘plug it in’ to charge. The other doesn’t require you to do anything other than drive the car as you would normally. Also, comparing a turbo to a hybrid system is ridiculous.My brother coming into the living room: *angry boi* Me in the living room: *dancing like a octopus in my Slytherin robe at the sound of "Last Christmas" trying to distract my sister from her homework and make her laugh* My brother: *happy boi* Yep, why drive your car to a smelly "self-charging station" and blowing £50 on toxic "self-charging liquid" when you can wake up to a BEV that has charged itself overnight?

Idk why the internet was so weird about this, I think all manic pixie dream girl movies would be better with an octopus Yea! I always find it better to ask engaging questions before the review on IG just to make the post visible to more people. It seems to get the books more exposure.

NO THE OCTOPUS COMPLETES IT Yeah, like having a Wordpress page, and a blog spot page, and a wix or whatever other hosts are out there. Publishing the same review across the board. I hope this is okay, but I may have to study some of the Instagram reviews you’ve posted, get a sense of things. Unless you are talking about the movie... then Doctor Octopus I glimpse the phrase “octopus award” on the mantelpiece...tell us more! Komodo dragons actually have venom glands, so they're venomous!
