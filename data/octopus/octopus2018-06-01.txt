It's telling that "Canadian Chinese food" is an actual distinct genre. We just repurpose other people's stuff and make it weirder. It's like in England there is fish and chips. Nothing else apparently 😆😆 YEAH when i got to that part i was like OMG.. hi again... Most of our really popular, really good cuisine tends to be variations of food from somewhere else which just got a Canadian twist put on it by immigrants. I'd honestly never had poutine until I came here and had it. It's really not that common in Canada. I think it's more the case that we just don't have much in the way of unique cuisine at all, so it gets the spotlight. My bad. I only know of one place in Tokyo that does poutine at all, so I figured I'd share it. There used to be a "Canadian restaurant" in Shibuya many years ago, but that has long since gone under. No idea if there are others now. It's also a world between hamburgers you eat with a knife and fork and a napkin in your lap...and your average McDonalds.
