My completely insignificant opinion is that the chance of ET life existing is very, very close to 1, and the chance of us encountering it is 0 (for reasons). The chance of communication is also zero (think octopus or ant for comm examples).

Het zou de verschillende soorten liefdes tonen. Ik kom later op de dag terug naar deze tweet voor mijn review. Interesting image, I live in an 80s property with no cavity wall insulation, I'm put off getting it due to horror stories about water moving across the gap via the insulation and causing damp. Have you had any issues? What type of cavity insulation did you use? I don't even want to ask about that one that looks like octopus tentacle. なんポイントになりました？ It is serious. It was a BBC documentary on a couple of years ago (I think) about a scientist who installed a tank in his house so he could live with an octopus.

They find the best and give you reviews as well. I’ve had smaller companies, Avro, Octopus and some others, no probs with any. Yep. It would have been about 10 years to pay for itself if I hadn't been. That said, probably a bit less as the car is electric and I got a good 2,000 miles "free" fuel last year. なるほど😂😂 やっぱりオクトくんですね！！！ no that only works for words that end with (us) octopus - octopi, cactus - cacti. the plural for of penis is penes (pronounced peeneez) or good old penises Are you on a FiT? No worries. There have always been floods. Humans are exacerbating them by concreting over large areas of land, so water runs off into rivers rather than soaking into the soil. Nuclear is just under £100, but the electricity is much more valuable because it isn't intermittent. SMRs are said to be much cheaper, but that remains to be seen. We'll have to agree to disagree. How do you explain the floods in Yorkshire Lincolnshire then? 맞아요!!!! Compressed air is about the same round trip efficiency as hydrogen, so it won't be cheap. Pumped hydro is stumped by lack of suitable sites. Gravity systems? Pull the other one! How much is Nuclear energy in comparison, and, how long does the waste have to be stored. What is your answer to the climate crisis, don't believe the scientists? How do you explain my 3500kWh per year solar system costing me nothing to run now it has paid for itself? Did you know that the US has just reached the end of the longest "drought" of landfalling hurricanes on record? Of the UK nations, only Scotland has seen an increase in rainfall. Why am i blushing???? Aaaaaa she is so cute ん？オトくんですね！ お願いします😂 Storms hitting the Southern USA, floods in the UK for starters. Lobsters are intelligent, often long-lived animals. I’m not a vegetarian and love the taste but I can’t bring myself to eat them now. Nor octopus. Clams, crab, shrimp, yes please.i got the happymad octopus as a balance time gift 🥺 What are the latest contract prices for offshore wind? I never mentioned hydrogen and would not bother with it. OTOH, there is compressed air, pumped water and weight options. 3週目か ㅜㅜ Which weather events do you think are becoming more serious? I suggest you check the IPCC's Fifth Assessment, Summary for Policymakers. See Table SPM1. By reading around. The companies involved are unlikely to release “data” don’t you think? 페코페코페코페코 6時間目まであるし俺らじゃないと思う The grid is going to run on offshore wind at £120-150. Storage will need to come from hydrogen. That's wildly expensive because turnaround efficiency is around 40%. I offer the large battery in South Australia as an example of why you are wrong. There are other different storage systems in the pipeline too. Also on Octopus, not sure which tarrif type, but looking at my smart meter price per kWh varies different times of day Everything from thecearliest cherry blossom recordings to speleothem data to the temperature record to sea level rise, to land ice loss shows evidence of recent rapid climate change.

Your evidence for this statement is? I ask as the projection for my solar to pay for itself was 6 years. Did it in 4.5ish. It now powers my car as well as the house over half the year.

The blue spots aren't the toxic bit, you might be thinking of the blue-ringed octopus Yep. Insulation is another big, big nice big cosy industry who've been found out their calculated u values aren't all that accurate. We need measurement e.g. this volume size house has to be below this kW... not "I think we've done enough now" I love this idea. I'd love there to be customisable squid/octopus forms in Splatoon 3 Yes, absolutely, but anyone with a super insulated house with a peak heat load of 18kW can afford to put in the system that supports it. I imagine the queen has quite high bills round her place. Fredward, this is the beginning of a beautiful adversarial friendship Only thing I would say against this is it pays back ten gold to insulate with heat pumps for a plethora of reasons.. cop being the main one Oh fuck off he’s not an octopus 1 pen and 2 1 on 1 shooting scenarios but let’s pile on Hugo like our defence didn’t just let Gundogan waltz in Octopus, everyone gets a leg!

You can have a super dooper insulated home that's 18 kW. So do we carry on get it down even further?

GET OCTOPUS AWAY Done. Octopus... I’ve only ridden in one city Hi Simon, I don't need to insulate to run at low temps at all. 6kW determines the flow rate which at dT 5 is around 0.29. Then if I want lower temps I increase surface area of my rads. Most heating should be run at low temp. It helps prevent corrosion for one Yeah my colleague recommended these silicone heel things to help with the breaking in/rubbing against ankles and they feel quite comfy!

But the point is we need to use less energy overall. So IMO, fossil fuel needs to be more expensive,to incentivise insulation,and ensuring condensing boilers run at low temps to minimise running costs,or making it more financially viable to fit a HP in the first place. People are their own worst enemy, they want a heat pump the size of a combi boiler with no installation disruption to heat a leaky house and then complain about the end result! 😭🤷🏻‍♂️ (But thats what they ask for)🤷🏻‍♂️ I just walk away and tell them to get someone else🤦‍♂️🤬 We'll give it 12 months and it could all change. You could see units that are ys plan compatible giving 60c hw and weather comp heating. Literally plug and play onto existing system. No need for cylinder change. It's coming 😉 also unit prices will tumble as soon as grants go I have a ship at sail so I can pick you up on my way by. My octopus can grab you. If I ever having window upgrades I'm getting Michael to do em🤣 He's cheap as chips. In fact that might be all I give him I do .. only since I started using as I can show a figure . Gas is much more forgiving as you know but typically massively oversized. 6kw at design is pretty epic .. I’ve never worked on a job that small/tight . That being said insulation isn’t expensive i respect the effort but i'm gonna have to say octopus on this one The point is, gas and oil is too cheap, electricity is too expensive.The reason why you need to insulate with a HP, is u have to run them at low temps to be able to compete with gas/oil.If they cost the same,run the HP at 60° and no need to insulate any more. The more I hear the more I am convinced that grants and subsidies are killing the renewables industry rather than supporting it. Two more wrap around her body, covering vee's tits completely.

Same as they don't work on rads comment 🙄 Mike told him a bunch of random names for things, so there’s some squid deal on the screen and he goes “oh! That’s Otto the octopus!” 🤣🤣 my octopus teacher - belgesel tadında muhteşem bir yapıt seriously for me it was from episode one, after that scene with the octopus I just fell in love :( The 2nd law doesn't change according to the heat source. Which is my point: why do we tell people to insulate for a HP but not a boiler? A requirement of 6kW is a requirement of 6kW... doesn't matter what heats it. If you advise insulate for gas as well then fair play to you.like omg i just ran over my dog i’m such a octopus 😂😂😂😂😂😂😣 I've emailed them three times in the last week and had absolutely nothing back. I will phone on Monday. Yeah. I get this.

Got residence 9 as they look original but have u value of 1.2 Octopus jimmy 2x It isnt the room stat thats the energy consumer its the flow tempreture of the heat source thats the efficency deciding factor Never a truer statement made 👍 🤣 bet they are lovely .. I can redo a sash window for a fraction of that inc a double glazed panel. What’s with the brand new brigade .. open loop open mind. Glass Nathan .. sash windows weren’t designed to be thrown out .. it’s why they make sash bar /parting bead etc still. Stick a double glazed panel in and it’s not expensive .. REAL World solutions. Nathan if electricity was as cheap as gas there would be no contest and heat pumps would suddenly be deemed 'efficient' and work very well in the cold. Talk to and ask their legendary customer service to fix it. My windows are around 1-1.2k each 🙈 Forget heat pump ... heat source .. maybe gas is better for him .. point being that you can change the glass and keep the window .. cheap as chips to do ... doesn’t have to be new but can be better for not a lot. A few hundred to replace a homes windows? You've been lucky. Time to get the rest of the washing done tomorrow then ⚡️ 🔋From the minds of Carey Mulligan and Rachel Bilson, a tombstone foments changes for an exciting octopus as they overtake a tourniquet, introducing Cory Monteith as the deliveryboy. (☆) If one of my old rural customers (an engineer)had saved up for a 6kW HP to be green I said no, not till you save up some more money for window panes. He'd have asked what kW his house needs to be then? I could only give him an arbitrary answer he'd rightly call me a fool. There is a major incentive to fit a heat pump before upgrading windows etc and that is MCS payment is matched to heat loss of house. Higher heat loss, higher payment. If you then insulate and improve windows etc MCS payment doesn't log it so stays at original amount 😁😁😁 Awesome, no worries about the delay - just curious to know when I can sign up :) Good luck in Australia, it's wild + interesting!

In my experience, I've not had any issues with my IHD. Egg? If you heat with electric you will save. Whether you save enough to cover your cost depends on a ton of variables.

I'd be the 1st person in history to develop Lizard/Octopus like regeneration abilities for that to happen 🙄 So the quickest way to cut emissions now at minimum capital cost per kg.CO2 saved will likely be a heat pump, not insulation. But long term the fabric upgrades are needed to make a fully renewable grid easier by reducing heat pump loads and facilitating more load shifting.地震でかくね ごめん、ごめんってば…ついつい色んなことに没頭すると浮上率落ちがち。（ガシガシと頭かいて）ゴメンって。mostimportantだもんねそりゃ心配だよね。(ニタァ) Oh also, you can switch HP off for longer at peak times if the building retains heat better.
