Coollike y'all are acting like he was thinking "omg gross niggers and their ghetto hairstyles. looks legit fried octopus." like 😐 bro it's a surface level joke that was just ignorant. not that it excuses it necessarily but is it a big deal Focus on using speed medals and the monochromatic keyblade. Smelly octopus was able to beat hades himself with a level 25 sleeping lion keyblade on his f2p account this is about how in the recent vlive the dreamies has, haechan joked about how chenle’s dreads looked like boiled octopus. and all the members laughed and we’re tryna educate the boys on it since it’s offensive. This isn’t trying to excuse him in anyway. But it’s clear he doesnt realize it’s bad. To say something like “octopus hair” sounds like something a child would say when they don’t know better. This is an education moment. I’m ashamed companies arent hiring cultural specialists. Umm you’re the ignorant because he said that about the hair style not about a fucking race and when he said it looks like an octopus because of the hair color because it’s true and it’s only a joke!!!!!!

There's serious money to be made from subsidy-free wind, far quicker easier than from fossil fuels nuclear, so it's a conservative's dream; look at all the wind farms in Texas.

And this is what my dong looks like *mouth explosion noises* On top of that, the think tank in question, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, considers all green incentives a waste of money, i.e. it wants to generate electricity as cheaply as possible. But subsidy-free wind IS the cheapest form of electricity, so why oppose it?can't handle y'all calling james buchanan barnes a terrorist for the reason he isn't cap. that's clownery. bucky? 100% innocent boy who deserves more. hydra? rot in hell and burn ugly octopus+ he just made a childish joke (because that’s what dreamies do).

Just because an openly biased think tank said something in a "report" doesn't mean it's true Some ICE car spilled oil on the track? Were you pulling up behind it? Is that like when an octopus squirts ink when it gets scared. First thing I thought of was an octopus 👀🤔 watch his vlive again he was reading the comments people keep mentioning chenle's hair and there are lots of idol who use this word a lot but comparing with octopus its more worse and taeyong didn’t make fun with that.please don't make this situation bigger.

Vulture 2. Green Goblin 3. Mysterio 4. Doctor Octopus ... but you’re not an Octopus American so I don’t think I can support this casting choice 😋 Would actually love to see how you do this, You little octopus you 🙄👀Wouldn't it be great if Dr Octopus became US President?

Can someone please teach these men a freaking lesson for onceI WANT SOME OCTOPUS 🐙 WIT RAMEN NOODLES B... 🍜 😒 They need an octopus motif on them...i would like a cold, wet octopus suctioned to my back I can't speak for other people, I'm speaking for myself and my understanding as to why I may be hurt by him calling Chenle's hairstyle octopus legs and the members laughing at it 💯 I’m sure it wasn’t with a bad intention, he’s just not educated enough about this stuff. Knctzens were the ones who brought up the “octopus hair” thing first and because of Hyuck’s ignorance it was funny to him. I’m not excusing his behavior though, he needs education, + if he’s speaking about the braids chenle has he’s speaking about braids in general. he said with his chest that they look like octopus legs so he needs to be educated about braids you’re just looking at the octopus part and not the full situationAsian flavors for me are so over done. But client pays. Octopus salad and octopus w/seaweed. My palate is stressed I remember being told it was called an "octopus plug" in elementary. I know it's wrong but I still call it that. Та не за что😍😍😍 I NEVER ACTUALLY THOUGHT STRING COULD BE THAT COOL 😭😭To educate thier staff and atleast make sure thier idols are aware of the culture and not disrespect it. I don't think haechan was trying to be disrespectful saying it looks like octopus legs, you guys take things way to seriously. (3) How can you say that he was nota referring especificly to Chenle's braids?! I've never heard him saying "all braids looks like an octopus, even for black people", and even more...why is octopus an offensive animal?!More humans should behave like elephants octopus (even though octopus terrify me) МЫ - ВЛАСТЬ so chenle's been promoting boom with cornrows which for some is cultural appropriation and then haechan called it "the octopus look" and that is like very disrespectful so like yeah we're all gonna die when you step on them, do you say sorry... octopus...😥 Itu culture nya bl ack people nder rambutnya..

This octopus would like to know. :3The most disappointing thing is they do clearly see our tweets (the octopus joke came from a knctzen’s). I think the best way is to inform either Johnny or Mark so they can educate the others. Make your octopus sha no fail when season start 😏 These are lovely and that octopus with its happy face is so cheerful I also read somewhere that knctzens made a joke about chenle’s hair and referencing it to octopus. overall, I don’t think Koreans really know that it’s offensive, but SM should bc they always got hate when they did it to their idols.octopus legs :((( i’m sorry i’m disappointed hyuck haechan called chenle’s cornrows octopus hair and made fun of it in general + dream making fun of chenles hair on stream (haven't seen the mv but he had cornrows I think? hyuck called it reggae hair or boiled octopus or smth) donghyuck said chenle should have his reggae hair that looks like an octopus im PRETTY sure he’s referring to the braids Fried octopus.... the fuck Haechan said that CHENLE'S HAIR LOOKS LIKE AN OCTOPUS, he nevera said that braids, people with braids or black people lokk like that, he said ir just for Chenle C’est Spider-Verse 2, le Heriters sont de retour et les Web Warriors doivent se réunir à nouveau pour éviter l’exctinction et cette fois c’est Miles et Octopus les leadersThat green octopus lady rockstar reminds me of Jade uhm nazwał je octopus hair wiec w sumie nie dziwie sie ze zrobili drameo to he called the cornrows chenle had in the mv “reggae” and “octopus hair”im seeing nctzens b like “it’s not his fault he got cornrows” :’(((( also nct dream: REGGAE BOILED OCTOPUS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂y’all more angry about hyuck calling it octopus hair than the fact that chenle got put in the cornrows in the first place 😭😭😭😭 Octopus Wants to Fight is awesome but I prefer Karma Citra.Like it’s not ideal....but if you forget the name of stuff you do just say random words to describe it... Obviously he called it octopus because it’s long strands(?), ropes(?) of hairHyuck needs to be educated. What he said was very insensitive and hurtful. However, Knctzens started the whole “octopus hair” thing. SK is still very close minded. I would take it such comments were made due to ignorance. He can learn and not repeat this again. hyuck called chenle's hair 'octopus hair' and THAT'S really offensive and people are cancelling him even though he doesn't know he's been ?rude?Is....the octopus hair thing that bad? I don’t get it, someone explain why it’s SO bad...? Fun Please I Said No Octopus Stir The Potwhich one of the ncts said the other nct’s cornrows looked like reggae boiled octopus 💀💀💀💀 And before this gets misinterpreted as me agreeing with the joke - I'm thinking of his thought process, and why a Korean would find that funny.
