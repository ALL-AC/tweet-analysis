Saw a guy at lunch rocking an Indians shirt. I say “Hey, Go Tribe!”. He looked at me like I had an octopus on my head. Obviously he isn’t originally from the area like I am. Uy, será el síndrome de R3... 🤔 Yo estoy en modo " a mí dejadme en paz, yo sólo quiero que esto se acabe rápido"Jyushiko Special Technique: Octopus Hold (sexe version) Agreed. Could extend any subsidisation point to every form of new (and most ageing) generation, too. Export needs to be economic and merit-based but there are uncertainties/blockers to that new world. It's also just hard. Will definitely be solved - unlikely by April. 6) getting your score on how well you did 7) no clocks, only a screensaver of an octopus moving across coral 8) total blackout round; complete darkness to consider your decision to avoid writing to play laser tag yep... "you're dead. wait, i'm dead, too"I just made an octopus. Depends on supplier/tariff structure, many acquisition tariffs lose on higher consuming customers if pitched for mid or low consumers (low standing charge) so actually helps those tariffs out Agreed, and complexity/costs to bill and settle that in a mass scale (for eg 4kw and less) could be considerable. Incentives should be created to solve that problem (not a subsidy necessarily) and regulatory/political framework must be long term enablers I wasn't ready for it to end. I want the octopus back a happy ending.... Beautifully written so imaginative though. Such description to build the worlds in my head. But “hit” is obviously for account of owner. Why should other 26m households subsidise the solar households in new world? To add, without that admin fee, post-FIT microgen will be in a bad position. Getting that export into the system is a big operation and a cost, as much as it's wanted by us all. The situation is that new small-scale gen is likely to be left unsupported unless someone takes a hit. If words do not come, story needs to be more fleshed out. I brainstorm on locations, characters, possible decisions that could change the plot. Constantly exploring the story keeps it fresh. I need someone to Photoshop Awstens head onto an octopus Singapore has had road pricing for 20 years, variable for about 10. But remember too that Hong Kong had the Octopus card for 20 years before anything like it got rolled out outside London!Playing Octopus's Garden by Beatles Yes, called FIT Qualifying Costs and designed to cover the overhead of making generation payments. Export processes are much more complex and that admin fee just doesn't cover all of. Extra £ is borne by suppliers or re-charged to generators - a situation where no one truly wins. I Remember I couldn’t tell if he was a elephant or a octopus Yes. Good thought. Surely when looking at payback for rooftop, not difficult to assume that fr first two or thee out of 40 year life there will be no export payments. Once regulation enables system to provide it, then rooftop owners will get it. Not a huge deal.... Harsh to say it but would not the loss from free provision of spilled electrons not be partially equalised by fact that behind the meter generation currently not fully paying for cost of connection nor contributing to socialised cost of renewables? Black grey octopus with viking sword and shield down the back of arm. I have 3 kids and I've got one for two and this is the last one. Also tiny one for the 17+yr old cat that just passed. holy shit octopus arms on her Also, could reluctance of suppliers to play in this market be linked to fact that those with own generation will buy fewer electrons than non solar house and so less profitable customer? 1) Giant Pacific Octopus 2) Mimicry Octopus 3) Giant Squid 4) Vampyroteuthis infernalis 5) Giant Australian Cuttlefish 6-800+) all other cephalopods! 🦑🐙 Isn’t it a question of having a fee for the provision of the service and then an export price that is calculated on actual price for half hour in which export is made.

In my view the domestic scale PPA will only take off once battery prices are low enough (PV likely required to initially make Household ROI attractive). Smart meter reading frequency (30 mins) is too low to enable full benefit for supplier, so will require further CAD etc. Pacific striped octopus 🐙 Evet tabi ki aq ndiayeyi ucuza kiraladık diye harika yönetim diyenler şimdi istifa diyor bu kadar dönek olmayın. Looked at this recently. You need an export meter fitted with own MPAN. Install seems to be £300-£400. Then PPA with supplier has annual standing charge to cover their admin meter reading costs.

Confused Octopus. 😆 +1 If there's genuine concern over a cliff edge, one policy approach might be a backstop PPA obligation index linked to the wholesale price minus a fair admin charge for export.

But if we remove the oversimplification of the map, I'd bet some Wu and Min dialects and as you said Vietnamese are harder than Japanese for a number of reasons For me the difficulty in Japanese is multifaceted: the topic-comment grammatical structure, a relatively big difference in terms of how compound words are formed, and the writing system all contribute.
