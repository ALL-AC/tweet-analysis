And what do you think is average driving daily distance in U.K. for 99% drivers. Оу, сильно. Cool. What did you drive, and how long did you use one for. ? If do use a public charger, there are a few different networks. Some use a contactless RFID, some just use debit cards (like petrol pump!), and some use App. (Many give you various payment options). Many are all moving towards now allowing debit card payments. Побыстрее бы уже А ИП чего ждать? From your clip, was it eating a small octopus...?🐙🦑🤔 Yes. And remember most charging is done overnight on home charger (like you do your phone😄), that takes 5 seconds to do, far quicker and more convenient than filling up petrol🤔 Also - fossil power stations are approx 60% more efficient than a car’s combustion engine plus I don’t run near power stations! Yes it’s a bit different charging a car to using petrol. However it also has advantages like being cheaper, and not poisoning those pedestrians you drive past. Принимаю May I ask gave you ever driven an EV? Yes we all draw out of a “common grid”. However if I set up a massive set of wind / solar farms tomorrow and put certain number gW into grid, I can then sell that amount of power to customers. Then those customers are effectively buying zero carbon by paying for that power. Grant, can you blog re this lot, I’m still bulb and 4kw pv so unsure it works for 4kw Of course there are renewable tariffs. Companies who introduce into network huge amounts of power into the grid. Hence if you join them you are effectively using zero net carbon.I dreamed the other day that I was an octopus and I was speaking in front of Congress about how plastic was a nonrenewable resource because the humans that made it were extinct and we needed to focus on more sustainable resources. Octopus, I vote for the octopus What, you need a mobile phone AND an internet connection as well to use an electric card. ridiculous. I need (and use) none of that for petrol or diesel car. It seems a lot more of a big deal to someone whose never driven an EV regularly, but in reality it’s a minor issue. 90% of charging is done at home. And usually you only will need one or two networks for your common trips. 95% time I am using as have them at work. Add on Add on GeniePoint (Any card can clone or Phone web), Pod-Point/CYC /Shell Apps and have vast majority covered. A few maybe but nothing like 30 needed! Hang on let’s chill a bit. That’s a bit of an exaggeration. Ok. So between Ecotricity App and PolarPlus card you already have good 70% plus of U.K. rapids. Then with (and done Polar) use debit cards.the keepers say that hank is around 3 years old, which is middle-late aged for a giant pacific octopus...he's starting to reject more difficult puzzles/enrichment and just sleep through most of the day now (valid of him tbh) Octopus motherhood Ok Octopus Maame So you haven't been watching the game,have you,Octopus?

Many other EVs you might find nicer (such as the iPace) but they are all better for the planet than ICE. Simple. I’ve been in many ICE cars that were horrible inside or had bad boot space - irrelevant. Stop with the mad ‘coal-powered’ FUD like your original image please. except that the japanese eat vast quantities of meat, fish,and baby octopus stuffed with a quail's egg as a treat on a stick ! and the italians love calves liver. I've been in a Tesla S, and BMW i3.

Gut feeling, after I ate Paul the psychic octopus  1) Hyundai Kona / Kia Niro / Tesla Model 3 2) On a Tesla you can remove the sim but good luck, do you have a smartphone that’s more likely to be tracked than your car. Strict privacy policies are required though I agree. I'm not scared of EV's, I would have one if: 1. They had decent range, currently you need to spend £60,000+ for that, impossible for most people. 2. All tracking devices are removed from EV's.

Thanks [Concerned octopus noises] Octopus! I love your characters too! Octopus integration! Very exiting. Shellfish (also a food term, not a biology one) are actually either mollusks (oysters, octopus, etc.) or crustaceans (shrimp, crab, etc.). That’s why you’re allergic to shrimp but not oysters. So fish and shellfish actually have very little in common, including allergens. You have a whole ocean, get some tentacle octopus action going, lol Dr. Octopus.why do I even bother posting to tumblr anymore, lol half of my posts refuse to show up in the tags, and with absolutely no reason, at that. just let me post my cycloptic octopus and let other people see her! or octopus owners Very happy to talk - atm I'm not sure of the similarity (other than in logo!).

Sure electric cars still rely on oil to create the plastics etc but not having to go and queue for petrol is so refreshing. Well, that depends on how much solar you have, how efficient your panels are and how heavy your right foot is but yes you're sort of right, it would be difficult to solely rely on solar (especially in the UK) but the fact that's possible is great in my book. You can only do that if you are doing short journeys. Fab news! Point added. Currently we're 1 - 0 to me. Shall we go on to the price? £0-£7 to fill up my Tesla (depending on how sunny it is at my home) which is good for 260 miles of range, the same in a similar powered performance car would cost me closer to £70. 😂 😂 I'm not eating nothing like Octopus Sushi.. 🐙 I will award you a point for electric motors getting near 100% energy use, versus approx 40% efficiency for petrol / diesel engines. Ноколотые бананас Also, I will never understand why people would rather pay insert the endless list of oil company names money to provide them with fuel to power their cars when instead they can buy solar panels etc and have no middleman ripping them off. Yup. But Nissan LEAF about 1/4 of the CO2 of a Nissan Micra using 2018 average grid mix. And the grid mix gets greener and greener each year. Don’t think I’ve met anyone who thinks EVs have zero env impact. But they have spectacularly less. Psycho Mantis. The End. The Boss. Laughing Octopus... There's a bit of a pattern there, isn't there? :P Your digestive system sees ‘maavadu’ one day and ‘octopus’ the next. It will do a Kejriwal....veg on odd days...non veg on even days😳 Something really unique. Maybe a new kind of playable character that plays differently to a Squid and Octopus. But there is such a thing called "cleaner energy" and that is what people who buy renewable energy tariffs are helping to add to the national grid. The more people that request a green tariff the cleaner the whole grid becomes. Думаю тоже записи поделать, может будет мотивация меньше отвлекаться на браузер (чтобы потом не монтажировать) Fine, but there's no such thing as clean energy. You can kid yourself into a "renewables tariff", but the fact is simple, it's called THE NATIONAL GRID, and there is NO DISTINCTION between wind, solar, fracked gas, gas, hydro, nuclear etc..

Researchers say that this type of RNA editing can allow a single octopus gene to produce an array of various proteins from the same DNA. 「さらば宇宙戦艦ヤマト」のメッセージ性の強烈さは、映画用に纏められたというのもさることながら、ほぼ要るものだけで出来ている事にある。 アンドロメダは旗艦なので１隻で良く、量産型はもっとシンプルな艦で十分なのだ。 特にサーベラーを沢山出す必要は全く無い。ズォーダーもうわ言は言うなと。 「規模は遥かに上回る（基幹艦隊も1000位上はあるので、設定上数億隻の艦艇が存在する）」マクロスでは話がそこまで破綻せず、2202では破綻している理由は「要らない道具を出しすぎ」という事に尽きる。 ストーリーが無駄に複雑すぎ、無駄に艦艇の数量が多すぎ、無駄にサーベラーが多すぎるのだ（真顔i got some octopus tentacles to cook and im not sure what i should do with them yet 設定を大仰にしすぎて話が破綻する（作らないで済むものを作った挙句、そのために話を回すようになる）ので、艦隊戦をやる場合の大艦隊の扱いは面倒なのだが、歴史上有数なのはゼントラーディ艦隊で、星雲渦状枝旗艦艦隊１つが500万隻（白色彗星の機動艦隊を軽く上回る）で、生産力ももっと大きい。When a bitch is tired you don’t make her shoot a fuckin Octopus for her you let her fucking sleep.
