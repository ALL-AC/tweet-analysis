Si maintenant la motivation vaut plus c'est cool. Tant mieux you tellin me a shrimp fried this ricei love the idea of this, but also, i dont think this all would be ~ bc spices are expensive so assuming you already have all the spices they used, yeah you could probably get this for about but also jumbo shrimp is lowkey expensive so dependsi understand that the recipe is more than ingredients but if you have any idea how to make boxed mac n cheese, cook shrimp and veggies, u can cook this. Dans ce cas, a moins d'être débile, il suffit de faire semblant d'être nul au début pour gérer une fausse progression.
