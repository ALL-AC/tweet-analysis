Octodad, the octopus disguised in human society, seeing his kind treated poorly and using his skills, wit and stretchable limbs to bust them out. Then slipping away at the last moment. Nobody ever suspected a thing.Of course Octodad would. If he saw those Octopus stuck in that tank of course he'd save them. Nearly everything lines up. He has the motive, we've seen him break glass in the exact same level this dialogue is in and we KNOW he has history with the Aquarium.But in the level before this one, Sea Legs, we clearly see Octodad comes from the ocean. So this escaped Octopus is not Octodad. But let's focus on that last line, it seems important. "or someone let them out" But who on earth would let the Octopuses out? (3/?)1: "The incident? You just forgot to lock the Octopus tank." 2: "I swear on Science it was locked! They broke free.. or someone let them out." So a few Octopuses broke out, the first thought would be that this Octopus is actually Octodad and this is where he came from. (2/?)Alright so here's my Octodad conspiracy. This all stems from a few lines of dialogue in the level Silent but Dadly that goes like this 1: "I saw an Octopus zooming around the tanks earlier!" 2: "That's impossible, we haven't had an Octopus since.. the incident" (1/?)3060のマイニング、octopusだと50%制限掛からずモリモリ掘れるぞ〜〜 does my invoicing now Where can I get fresh octopus in Mobay?Franz has octopus tentacles for arms 女性でこんなにイケメンだと男の立場が😱😱😱 On invoicing weekend as well...you’re nailing the work-life balance!
