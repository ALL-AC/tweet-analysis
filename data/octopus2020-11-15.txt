That's why I think precious metals Gold seems to do better than the stock market in the long term. There's no 'dividend' from gold but the value appreciation still wins.If you’re into weird documentaries, give My Octopus Teach a watch on Netflix!

Al octopus いうて、ペンギンに食いちぎられて誉れを失ったってことにしといてあげるのも誉れだから…… Wishing men were more like the octopus it works for the energy co when scaled up to thousands or hundreds of thousands of cars and GW scale batteries cycling the demand at any one moment you set the lower limit your battery needs at all times.

This issue marks the first appearance of Dr. Octopus.

They get the use of a 40-50kwh battery you get the energy you actually use, for free (or reduced). As long as you don’t chain more than one layer you should be good—I’m running chains through the separate inputs on my Extron, like a gangly RGB octopus. これで20日のゼルダ無双まではツシマのマルチモードで遊べる…… Yeah.

With tentacles and wiggliness! I've bought a mould to make some, I can't wait for them to arrive x They'll pay you 5p kwh for export and charge you 15p kwh - you need to export 3kwh for every 1kwh you import to make it a zero sum game... at which point any long term storage that is better than 3-1 efficient in its cycle is 'worth it'. cute reversible octopus -octopus females will starve themselves looking after their eggs. They become their babies’ first meal -the males will live for a bit after mating and will mate with other females before dying -male anglerfish will become a parasite on the female Nice! 통화해주면 해줌 Antennas?

I need to invest in my pension so solar is compared against stock market investment for me They haven’t but others have virgin/SMS octopus ovo ecotricity are all innovating for instances like this.. OMG SAME WITH THE OCTOPUS sabe que va a acabar en el valmayor y dando gracias jajajajOctopus in the pumpkin 🎶 There are more reasons to do it than money - it's a reasonable investment if you have money earning 0.25% interest sitting in a bank - but sure - you could buy gold/silver and sit out the crash then buy it when it's cheaper still the metals have skyrocketed in price. Your once most reliable goalkeeper who now has slippery hands like an octopus lol Not if you have domestic batteries - first you charge those. You could even have a diverter so that once your batteries are charged any surplus goes to the hot water tank... but sure in Summer you'd still have a surplus unless running air-con or something in winter a shortfall. シンディよりアネモネの方が欲しい俺w 良かったね、おめでと🎁🎂🎉 I keep wanting to buy solar but the numbers don’t add up right now, it’s just not a good investmentJust finished My Octopus Teacher on Netflix and it was just really lovely. why do you rate Ringo so highly? is it Octopus’s Garden? But that's a grid connected system - not an off grid system. You can get hybrid systems that can function offgrid if there's a power cut - but most can't. Even the ones with batteries. Yeah and a lot of that is rooted in the Rothschild giant octopus conspiracy theory which basically was the premise for Henry Ford's "The International Jew" which was Hitler's biggest inspiration and the John Birch Society's "Cultural Bolshevism" which is now "Cultural Marxism". Normally you export to the grid and then buy back No I mean on your electric bill charge a higher % tax on amounts over X units a month lol... that's what happens anyway Yeah! Since the Ziggy thing happened it’s always the same. Someone attacks and Shiki is the one who rush’s into battle. And after 3 times (Ziggy, the octopus on Red Cave and now with the glue guy) it’s just boring and a bit annoying (for me at least) You could use your solar stored in your battery while being off grid and then go back on grid when it runs out what even if it comes from your own PV batteries? I also have that colour octopus I can't really retweet that. The awfulness supersedes the humor. I think I may despise politics today. I'm watching the Octopus love affair movie again. I've had to go to a lot of events like this over the years. Everyone always thinks it's great to give the gaijin a "taste of Japan". I can't eat seafood. It's always a nightmare. only if you're 100% off grid. Yeah so you're half an octopus? 🐙 Like I said - when there's enough. ATM there's only about 300,000 of them in the UK - but that'll change fast enough if the economy doesn't completely collapse before then. don't invalidate octopus, they have 8(?) hands What are octopus arms?! all I retained is images of drunk johnny depp and keira knightely in some island or something... there was also a dude w an octopus beard somewhere in there octopus bkn?

How deep octopus hands of rulers control us?An interview by Mr. Druv Rathie with 1 former IT Cell appointee.I kno Mr. Druv is an AAPian bt all of us must kno wht erstwhile IT Cell person is telling. It would be fairer just to tax home electricity after all it doesn’t really matter if it’s used for a car or for heating or cooking Or both... or do away with road tax put it all on energy (like a carbon tax would).OCTOPUS ROBOTS develops and markets mobile, autonomous, smart and modular robots for use in various industries such as agricultural business, defense and surveillance .io  Yowza, this is my nightmare. It could be but it’s inside the car so only on new cars with a new regulation Listen to me here (the bees were in the election 1.14 release of bees at 1.15, goats in the election 1.16 appeared in 1.17 octopus at the election 1.17 and appear at 1.18) you know why I thought so much of what was a new mob then The first layer finds the octopus. I use those coordinates to create a new video centered upon the octopus. A second layer trained on the centered videos finds the arm coordinates. You're missing the point - that socket leads to a charge controller - that charge controller can very easily be metered. You could just charge road tax based on the miles you do per year, that’s much easier All current cars can be charged via a normal 13A socket or a 16A commando too 1. lol wholesome little octopus dude. 2. Jeez I hope no one on the bus is looking at his piss-cum continuum chart :/ so you don't think all those gov'ts will get together and make a reg when they realise how much money they're losing every year? jellyfish inspirrred, starrrfish, seahorrrse at da octopus You can use domestic electricity - but it has to go through a car charger like above. Those chargers only need a 'smart' connection for the electricity to be charged at a different rate. Damn just realised - I'm probably giving 'them' ideas - I'll shut up now 🤣 Use one model to find the octopus and create the follow cam video. A second model to do the arm labeling.trying to carrot get an octopus even tho i only learned how to crotchet this morning 🤪 octopus one though, the one holding friend, is gonna throw friend at menko If you wanted to charge via the cars log you would have to make an EU regulation for that, oopst ㅇㅇ 친구해 그래OCTOPUS!! you can use pink diesel too. EVs have a chip that logs all the charge cycles.Watched My Octopus Teacher on Netflix-highly recommend. 아 씹덕댓글달아달라구... But I can charge from a 13 amp socket. Or both Same here been waiting since may for a date. Um. Good question. About 58 pence per litre. 😬 Basically it’s not workable, road charging will replace fuel tax in the future 둘이친구할래? a sexy octopus, I agree!! That big big kpanla paaa and octopus! And if it's hot Koraa de3 3ne3 shun! We bought Veronica the octopus from amazon :)I'm going to start, because they both came up in a discussion of Really Meaningful Things We've Seen and my gremlin brain decided now is the time for nonsense: Lovecraft Country = My Octopus Teacher Yeah and people drive around using pink diesel even though they shouldn't. I know people in Spain who don't even go via their meter - they get an electrician to put in an un-metered line (loads do it nobody snitches). Belum aja nana spill soal baby octopusAnything that’s camouflage is an alien, i don’t care what anyone says.

If you really think Joe from Essex won’t plug his car into the garage socket as it’s illegal you must be smoking something But if the only car charger you could buy, had a 'smart' meter on it too, then they could. 아니... With micro-inverters you can plug a solar PV system directly into a 13a plug to your home too - but not legally. Without all that gov't regulation stuff... all sorts of stuff is 'possible' but gov'ts just make regs so you pay the tax or risk a hefty fine or whatever. omg is this a clown-octopus hybrid??? why is it holding money?? i'm scared That's pretty cute! Hmm, mine are a realistic parasaurolophus from Berlin and octopus from Victoria (Canada), a really cool dragon from Cambridge and Jimbo from Jimbo and the Jet Set from a rummage sale! I have a smart meter. No difference in the draw of elec to charge car to having shower with electric shower unit. I like marine invertebrates, many are beautifully colored and an octopus can change color and appear to change textures. I’m upset that Gavin would insult those beautiful creatures by comparing them to Mitch McConnell Nice but why are you turning my boy Doyoung into an octopus 😭😭😂😂😂😂😂 he would be so pissed if everyone gets a dragon and cool shit like that and then he’s an octopus 😂😂 Do you not know how PETTY Doyoungie is? XD That’s unenforceable as you can plug a car into a normal 13A socket am no a fucking octopus Oh come on - of course they can - they just make it illegal to have a charger without a meter. They can’t know if the electricity you use is for a car or for home, so all they could do is just tax home electric more but that wouldn’t go down well So the crew get him back from death by turning their boat upside down, and then the demon octopus man wants to fuck the ocean and also his heart gets stabbed and the guy with the dad becomes the new ocean demon man. Then it turns out guy's dad is on a weird sea demon's ship and Jack made a deal with him and time's almost up, so he finds the demon guy's heart. But then Barbosa is alive again and Jack is eaten by an octopus. Of course they can. The Tories in Spain were in the pocket of the fossil fuel cartels while wind was promoted domestic solar was hit with a punitive tax over and above your grid connection charge, unless you were 100% off grid. Far from pay feed-in, they charged you for it. octopus october【オクトパス】タコは英語で「octopus」だね☆この「octo」はギリシア語で数字の「8」という意味で、「pus」は「足」という意味で、名前で体を表しているのよ♪ちなみに「タコの頭」って足の付け根から眼までで、丸いところは内臓だよ。さらに、イカやタコの眼って盲点がないの！DO NOT SLANDER THE OCTOPUS! SOrry but they show intelligence, compassion and make the ultimate sacrifice for the future generations and Moscow Mitch has never shown any of those traits. Good thing people don’t have a preference for octopus boys!

Hilarity ensues. You most likely have a veiled or Jackson chameleon. Panther Chameleons can produce nice bright blues and reds however the transition period between colors is much slower and no chameleon has this range of color. An octopus on the other hand changes like this. I see your Wild Honey Pie, and raise you Octopus's Garden. Sorry Ringo. Reminds me of a long ago interview with John Lennon, when asked if he thought Ringo was the best drummer in the world, he replied "he's not even the best drummer in The Beatles". This makes... no sense with the cables coming out the back. Just like how the trashcan Mac ended up looking like an octopus with all the external devices attached to it. octopus aja nyarinya kalo di syopii?His were , he was like an .

They also change colour and shape in an instant tw/ squid tentacles because some people have gotten sick eating raw octopus before So sad octopus are soo intelligent I love them and they only live one year And the way they raise turkeys for the holidays is cruel.
