Like I get where you’re going with this.. because the human couldn’t open 3 knobs at once, but the octopus doesn’t have the concept of designing a trap instilled in its instincts. That’s not a feasible thought process for an octopus that’s what separates man from beast. Because octopus 🐙 is an animal that has more than 2 “hands”.

And it wouldn't have to be an octopus doing the locking. 3 doorknobs which have to be turned at the same time to open the door probably would keep most humans locked up. I’d just make the entrance just big enough for the octopus to squeeze through and put no door on at all. The door knobs idea is freaking genius though. So we got an octopus locking up humans for whatever reason. But because hes got 8 arms hes gotta be better at doing than we already are? Why not just one door knob on the outside. Or put two keyed knobs on either side. Not all problems require the fullest extent of your brain i'll let this one slide because the last time you talked about the 3 doorknob octopus thing was in 2010, but im watching you neil When I get imprisoned by an octopus, I promise you I will spend the whole time pissed off at you.

I dream about maintenance crews installing extra large door knobs on every door in the WH. I'm still wondering why not a single octopus has weighed in on this issue here -- so important to them it would seem. They must be excellent typists Or none. The octopus could squeeze out under the door. But in this case the octopus would only be able to lock up 3 humans in a single room without locking itself in or out of that room (7 or 8 doorknobs)Sticky elemental octopus, eye stalks Health: tough (3d HP) Armor: unarmored (6) STR: +0, DEX: +2, WIL: +2 Attack bonus: +3, crushing Weakness: wormwood The Octopus is smarter than we are.

No octopus arms.... but sticky notes!!! We are all learning!!! An Octopus can’t design shit. Why is octopus capitalized? Did Trump write this? Question is, why would the octopus want to lock the human in a room in the first place? And who wouldn't use their foot for the third knob? Truthfully the octopus would only need to design the door with two knobs far enough apart so the human couldn't reach both? Question: How would an octopus lure such a human into this cunning trap? I haven’t been able to find never-frozen octopus in Texas. Very bland stuff. Because an octopus can simultaneously turn three knobs! You knobs The octopus would do well to not discount those of us with weirdly dextrous feet... I’m going with 5 doors for the Octopus.

SIR, sir, an octopus is INCAPABLE of building a door, and I suspect you already know thisI just knocked a bottle of wine off the table and caught it with my foot inches from the floor, so bring on Doctor fucking Octopus 'cause I've clearly been bitten by a radioactive spider. If an octopus had a room to lock a human in, it would be underwater. Only one lock needed, sans air. Seems to me that said octopus might also have a sick sense of humor and design one of those doors with eight door nobs...just for shits and giggles...

Any way we can get an octopus hired for general maintenance for the oval office/west wing/ you know what I mean? It'll either be bears, dolphins, or octopus who inherit the earth after humanity is gone. Maybe crows, but they'd need thumbs first. Then again an Octopus hasn't experienced the wonder that is driving with our knees... Or knees for that matter. The Octopus installs ADA compliant levers making it much easier to open all three!

You've just given me some renovation ideas for the bosses at work. because an octopus could open a door with three doorknobs I, for one, welcome our new octopus overlords. May they never squirt ink in fear again. I once knew a guy who could open a doorknob with his foot, so the three doorknobs in the octopus’s room would have to high up. Hopefully so, because as a human created with a creative mind, I can think of a dozen ways to get around something so simple. (But please don't tell this Jailer Octopus.)I am a octopus, I cannot breath without water So I put diamonds on my tentacles 🐙 I can buy candy any time I want already?

I think the octopus would need four Where does the octopus factor in the no doorknob scenario?🐙 Do it only makes sense to use the bulb of the octopus to swallow the original door knob and then twist at least in thesis why octopus ... why...

Of course, that assumes an octopus can count. ;)Why is an octopus needed to design this room. Seems to me if an octopus is aggressively trying to trap me somewhere im probably dying of a heart attack anyway.

But uhm, how long can a Octopus life out of the water? Now all the octopus needs are opposable thumbs and a much larger brain to design and operate such a device. That sounds like fun. What other octopus related ideas can we come up with! :) seems to me if a human wanted to lock an octopus in a room all they would need to do is seal the room and pressurize it to equal that of the octopuses suction and his suckers would not work!! I can see the headline now, "Neil deGrasse Tyson aids Poseidon, starts octopus uprising of 2018, solves age old question 'How did Atlantis Fall'? Answer: too many doorknobs". There must be more to this statement because it does not stand on its own. If an octopus had the ability to design an exit with three doorknobs (are we assuming there is a door?) then the octopus can design a working lock. I, for one, welcome our new Octopus Overlords. Is the octopus cute? Why an octopus? Why does it matter who is making the door/trying to lock a human in a room Well it's good then that it's a fucking octopus then innit Nah.
