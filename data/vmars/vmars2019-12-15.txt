 I deliberately used the word happy, considering the discussion of whether the heroine could be happy and still be interesting. I’m glad that “correcting” me made your day. Have a great weekend. It's literally a tweet written by someone calling themselves "Cancel Veronica Mars". That seems like a pretty named group to me. I know..i had to use my pixie spy magic I can understand, though I disagree, with commenting on posts that are aiming to cancel the show, as that serves an interest (I.e., to not cancel the show). Commenting on this, which criticizes a nameless group, is pointless. No one’s mind is being changed. A S4 fan who knows about the show? What witchcraft is this? Echo chambers exist on both sides of an argument, and you’ve clearly brought buddies from your own. Give your likes and scroll past the rest. The fandom is already shattered, more arguing is just beating a dead horse. 1/2 {sigh} I guess..No one writes songs about the ones that come easy....gonna force my sisters to watch the vmars movie tonight Like you're really so willing to be stupid in public, it's amazing Well don’t use the shows tag to attack other fans with straw man arguments if you don’t like them responding, of course people are going to ‘butt in’ if they see the fans being called disgusting and disturbing for liking a television show You know this is a public website, right? I look at the hashtag because I'm a fan of Veronica Mars. If you don't want your point of view questioned, don't post it in a public space where it can be. Ugh. Sorry people can’t seem to let you make your points without butting in. Clearly some people are still trolling the Veronicamars tag for someone to attack! And what of female fans who can't wait for more? Or do we have to agree with you? You know, because all women have one opinion? I’m hitting blue though, BB was corny as hell Sunday 🏂🏂 Hi, could you send me a picture of the box showing the expiration date? Please keep in mind that dates in Argentina are displayed as DD/MM/YY. Thanks getting good☝🏾 Vmars!!Esta serie de me tiene enganchadisima😍 They really did it for the fans. I remember as a child watching the hell outta VMars.

LATINX VMARS x GAMECHANGER This is fake deep 🤦🏼‍♀️🙄 Boom roasted Agreed a THOUSAND % 👀my next days off work are Sunday and Monday so those are gonna be my actually rewatch vmars days because I said I’d do that my other days off and ended up reading logan and veronica fanfics🥺 Nice, I'm midway through s3 of *my* VMars rewatch. Man that show holds up (though re-watching makes me realize why so many didn't care for the s4 re-boot—V needs friends around her, not just wisecracking with dad) I honestly can’t believe the VMars finale, it’s been months and I’m still not over it 😭😭 thank god for the movie thoughwhen i first read the vmars books and I brought them everywhere because I was so attached🥺🥺🥺 a true crime podcasted doing it for fodder for his show is where it’s at. tho does vmars s4 count as that? Also both those VMars books are pretty good. Haber tenido más temporadas de Sense8 o rehacer el final de la cuarta de VMars.my sisters and I are doing family game night and tonight is hang man. they won’t stop doing the office and vmars phrases ✅I miss the days i could peruse the tag without seeing hate :( esp for kbell, yeah i get why people are upset and they have every right but vmars used to be my safe space and now its just tainted :((Maybe we could send fountain pens or (reg. pens because that's cheaper instead to networks w/ it. It worked for vmars. What do u think? Where is it? I want to vote against her too and put on the standard puke face...but I’m not bitter.been feeling way too lost recently to not rewatch vmars eps and get a fleeting moment of clarity
