 I live for your vmars tweetsthe theme song in s3 of vmars was so disappointingJason Rothenberg is such a POS. Like dude, you really really really ruined a great character arc. It is dead to me. Also, I'm retconning everything in my head, so. 🤷‍♀️ I watched Pretty Little Liars, The Vampire Diaries, Game of Thrones AND VMars, I've had PLENTY of practice. YOUVE SEEN VMARS ? i genuinely only care about my top 5 and dawsons creek ranking dead last... i have to finish vmars and btvs thoKnew it was the creepy dude!! Ms Marin rly stole that ladies' .. Hanna better be okay!! Ezria are back tog 😍 the fb remind me of Vmars I wonder if he and KBell had kept in touch at all from the VMars days. A few things 1) there is zero chance of the prequel without Jason. It’s his baby. 2) DD signed a major deal with Netflix and have numerous series in the works 3) Vmars could easily just be about ratingscurrently convincing alyssa to watch btvs and vmars in dms rn by sending endless edits im convinced that by watching VMars last year i had caused it, but tbh i think it’s just toxic male showrunners watch me make a vmars list and it’s just you we literally cry together over ALL our shows oth, the oc, vmars, buffy it’s honestly the foundation of a perfect friendship wait link me theo’s explained a lot of vmars to meComencé VMars, estoy viendo a papi Damon otra vez🤤not me rewatching vmarsStill fascinated by the hatred for season 4 of VMars, even my PROFESOR refuses to acknowledge it! Yes, I hate the ending. Yes, I hate what it means for the series. But it's a good season besides that! The mystery wrapped up well! I adored Matty! I just want to talk about it! vmars handhold lost in that one specific regardRight now I’m reading ‘s YOU’RE NEXT and it’s giving me serious Veronica Mars vibes. (And that’s a great thing. I love me some VMars.) hell yeah!!! probs not tonight bc yeah test and hw but tomorrow perhaps!! cant wait to find out what shit went down in vmarshappy friends, lost AND vmars anniversary omg i guess every show obsessed w premiering on the 22nd vmars is by far one of the most exciting shows I’ve ever watched the plot is just so inTENSE. parks and rec, vmars, gilmore girls and firefly You Vmars’d it! nice!!!!!anyways all my moots better watch gilmore girls along with vmars which I have just started but am already in love with 3Thinking about the time I went to a VMars cast signing at the Mall of America and gave Jason Dohring a Logan mix I’d made, then he later mentioned it in an interview. Truly the peak of my fangirl career cant be worse than vmars s4the scene in the vmars movie where dick, logan, weevil, wallace, and piz all fight in defense of veronica???? I LOVE THEM.I was thinking oh I’m glad I didn’t keep up with The 100 and get fucked over like that but remembered that Rob Thomas fucked me over so severely with VMars S4 What?!? VMars is my favorite show ever.* *except the last five minutes of the new episodes bc I refuse to accept certain things. vmars Oh gosh I hope they don't remove themselves from this list with the reboot like VMars did 😅vmars ile olmuyo mahlas lazim Would recommend VMars. This’ll be probably the fifth time I’ll have seen the entire series all the way through, but the first time since the Hulu season dropped. Oh I believe that! Same and same! I rewatch it often (though probably not as often as VMars lol)just realized i still haven’t watched the vmars movie I will agree. Pretty great pilot. The ending of season 4 of VMars also counts as my worst ending of all time.my next edit is gonna hit so hard if i can actually find vmars scenes 😐 from the vmars wiki trivia section “The title of the episode refers to what is splattered all over Dean O'Dell's car after he announces that the Greeks will remain on campus.” Not great or relevant enough considering everything else but 🤷‍♀️ Also gross. I LOVE THIS!! also this gives me big season 1 of vmars logan energy but maybe that's a reference only I get If I'm defensive about KB/utter lack of Emmy recognition...15 yrs since VMars and she's had great performances between then and The Good Place. I respect your opinion, but don't you get the feeling O'Hara's certain Emmy win Sunday doesn't smack of lifetime achievement, too?
