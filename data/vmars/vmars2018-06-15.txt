 DEFINITELY!!!! VMARS FOR LIFEEE Yes! I'm vmars ðŸ˜Š If vmars does a come back as a full on pi with her law degree and mac by her side.. The whole ðŸŒŽ will be blown away!! ITS SO GOOD!! So many vmars crossovers! how fare are you in VMars Thanks brotha ðŸ’¯All you yung'uns, if you haven't yet, must watch . This, along with VMars, are good series to watch alongside Riverdale for strong female leads, snarky pop culture references, and the dark/murder mystery element ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ this is obvious but DUNCAN IS THE WORST!!  Dust off those DVDs anyway. VMars is the bomb! PERFECT description. I always called Piz the Riley of VMars!! Like...you are a nice guy, but you are in over your head here....you want the idea of these girls but can't actually handle the storm. Technically not a detective...I contend sheâ€™s an undercover agent for my team. I would have put VMars instead but was trying to stay away from ones in picked in the ep, and Juliet Oâ€™Hara was just picking the Psych team.
