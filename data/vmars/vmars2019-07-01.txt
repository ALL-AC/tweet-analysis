going to continue vmars now I feel like the worst Vmars fan ever!! Thank you!! VMars is. So. Good. Please tell me you watch iZombie? ...there are VMARS trading cards???🤯 I’ve never heard anyone say they prefer S2 of Vmars over S1! I’m so intrigued hahaThe saddest thing ever was Weevil’s grandma not getting to see him graduate the only one i accept is vmars going on hulu. i'll let that one slide.If the vmars reboot doesn’t mention the epic quote i’m gonna be: sad Julio* If you got him in fantasy last year your blessed all I gotta say ! Mike Thomas is my number 1 overall wr in the nfl Idk it’s tough d hops don’t drop shit either Can’t argue with you on that just hate odel and I know everyone will say him so I had to say julioooo That’s the mottoAlmost done with vmars season 1 and if leronica doesn’t quit fighting I sweari just saw a vmars spoiler i want to die You know that’s a LIE. This is a first. What’s Vmars without the movie though?? How can I possibly have s3 be my last visual?!And I guess I’m gonna read the 2 VMars books because IS COMING BACK IN A MONTH!I’m worried about the new cover of We Used to be Friends for the new VMars series.hey the guy who played ryan in hsm is on vmarsgoodnight beliza is married and vmars is coming back 3 samee lit rally check all the edits in my vmars album once a day I know exactly what will happen. We'll plan to watch VMars and then you'll change your mind and we'll end up watching UTD and Haven🤣Hulu gonna be like "damn bitch, you watched VMars 35 times in six days, you good?"after i finish dawsons creek i have to rewatch vmars before season 4my entire tl watching/rewatching vmars i think thats beautifulonly two episodes left of vmars... i cant do this no no nowe going 🛫 season 2 of vmars new vmars in like a month!!!vai ter vmars na sdcc 🥰🥰🥰 I don’t feel like lining up early for McGrath knowing I can catch her in Van. Still debating whether to line up for VMars on Friday. Tfw you’re happy for VMars but GoT will probably be Hall H on Friday 😭 time to start working on my decisions.i really hope i can finish vmars before the revival comes outvmars just keeps getting better omg why didn't i watch it before Acho que ele estava com preguiça, lembro que até a S03 era uma série mediana bem divertida, mas essas duas últimas estão sofríveis. Não sei se ele estava ocupado com outras coisas, ele tava desenvolvendo outro piloto e gravando VMars. Tem décadas que um cérebro bom não aparece.i can't stop watching vmars i literally haven't left my bed all daythere’s one vmars x-overdid I begin my vmars rewatch on the episode where Logan and Veronica have their first kiss? Hey maybeonly one season left of vmars.. pls i deserve better ME TOO! one of my favorite things about vmars movie was him getting into a fight AGAIN because of the same thing. the freaking sex tape. even tho that must hurt like a bitch, he just can’t stand still when it comes to veronica 😂😂❤️i need to continue vmars but i cant stream stuff without my computer buffering every 5 seconds this is not a belief endorsed by us! big vmars love from laura I AM SO HYPE. I will not lie- I still jam out to the VMars soundtracks on a regular basis.the revamped vmars song is disGUSTING. the original slaps so fucking hard why did you do this.eu revendo vmars e pensando como me deixei ser enganada por esse término dramático entre a veronica e o duncan na 2a temporada, ó coisa com cara de plot dela pra alguma coisa! só fui entender no fim do epi mesmo as I try to wait patiently I listen to the VMars soundtrack 🎶🎶🎶 remembering LoVe and the gang! Omg it needs to be July 26th already!!!!! Oh yeah I love him now! And Adam Scott seems great. It was just bad timing lmao, I watched VMars about a year before starting Parks and my subconscious Remembered himOh great it’s the VMars episode that made me mistrust Ben Wyatt for literally three entire seasons I mean that’s two very different thingsIf I had the cash, I'd get the rights and make a dark as hell / awesome AAA VMars game for and  Beyond jealous you get screeners for VMars! WELCOME TO MY WHOLE LIFE but also that song existed before VMars! AND NOW I HAVE STOLEN IT FOR MY OWN USESmy favorite shirt from like a year ago was a veronica mars t-shirt that I got from a thrift store for . I need some more vmars apparel bc fred must have stole it out of my house🙄 I wanna do a rewatch too! But I'm also thinking I need to do a complete VMars rewatch before July 26 so may not have the time. "Is"? You've just forsaken the character development after all these years. Why you were VMars panel mod back then. He's not Aaron nor Spike, damn. I guess you won't be watching the new on hulu or any of shows now.i feel strongly about this clearly but man...... vmars isnt a show about love triangles and logan has always been the one for veronica and thats it. team LoVe and shipping veronica w all the girls is the only lane.hulu is putting the old vmars seasons up on my birthday so y'all better watch now, literally no excuses who tf is this 😂😂😂 I hit B Aye thanks cuzVMars is gonna be on Crave in Canada! 😃 VMars is gonna be on Crave in Canada! 😃 VMars is gonna be on Crave in Canada! 😃 That is all 😬lmao duncan finally left vmars, time for the logan and veronica show to rise Christine are you doing a VMars rewatch?i need a link with captions for vmars i can't eat and listen at the same time😔ok continuing the vmars pilot now Ive been crying tears of joy for months now in anticipation of the vmars season (sadly not even joking a little)! I had the DVDs watched them til they died from use. This season looks absolutely AMAZING. Your show has meant the absolute world to me!Jessica Chastain is in this episode of VMars and I was so surprised I choked on my dinnerVMars coming to Hulu July 26th- hell yes!!!Ok so and I got talking about VMars fanfics back in the first three seasons, and it got me searching for old favorites. If I find any fics, would anyone like me to start a thread for them? omfg jessica jones was physically painful to get through. i feel like vmars does a MUCH better job of it?? vc assiste vmars vamos ser amigas Veronica Mars s1 is an all-time for me and I think s3 is generally underrated. Also, VMars fans should not fail to watch Party Down, an incredibly good comedy made by basically all the same people. When’s the new season coming too!? 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 YASSSS VMARSstill think the vmars revival would have been better if they made it a JAG au about logan echolls being IN THE FUCKING NAVYdecidi rever vmars mas sei lá quando tenho 40 diaswhen vmars comes out someone let me know if they break up logan and veronica cause if they do I'm not watchingOH MY GOD VMARS IS BACK AND MY MARSHMALLOW HEART CANNOT TAKE THE SUSPENSE Logan is all angsty and Logan-like. When you want to make your new bathroom Veronica Mars themed (because why wouldn’t you), and you suddenly realize a VMars bathroom line doesn’t exist. 😩 / , when can I expect the home decor to drop? 😂A new season of is coming and there's no more - it was so much a part of my experience of watching the first 3 seasons to then read a recap. So I'm sad about that. But so happy to get some more
