Neptune really likes its spitballs. I forgot that TV shows used to have 22 episodes a season! How am I going to catch up on my VMars? I haven‚Äôt watched a 22-episode season in years! He's obviously very anti Wallace on VMars i think the LoVe storyline runs parallel with her PI storyline and one of the central themes of the show which is do you do what you love or do you do what's easy, and vmars has always come down on the side of, do what you love even when it's hard and it hurts.stop it if vmars s4 breaks up leronica or kills keith or both i'm riotingWow I FULLY repressed that Sexy Mumbly Deputy on VMars went on to play the Swarley type on New Girl. Why did he ever start enunciating!?Somthing that's really hitting me during our VMars rewatch is just how **well constructed** the plot is in S1. The overarching whodunnit is carefully seeded, while distracting us w/ such great red herrings. And they do it w/out sleeping on the mysteries-of-the-week. wait. I need to read this. I want to know 18-year-old Taylor's thoughts on masculinity in VMars!!Watching the season 1 vmars finale. GOD the first time I watched it, the reveal of the killer, what a fantastic shock.I was, and still am, delighted that I got the TV Club Classic reviews of VMars, but every time I go back I wish I'd done it on multiple views of the show instead of the first time, because there's so much more you can do like that. YESSS! I discovered VMars back when you had to rent DVDs from a store and my local spot recognized me bc I watched the first two seasons on a loop for an entire summer and would just keep coming back to take the same thing home That‚Äôs fair. I also haven‚Äôt seen VMars in a while so the weak performance has kind of stuck with meSigned up for a free trial month of Hulu just for Veronica Mars okay, this may be a better interface than Netflix but it's still awkward. Also I'm watching S01 of VMars it skipped a crucial episode in that autoplaying of next episodes thing that it does. Grrr. Wait, is this your first time watching VMars? WAIT NEW VMARS ?! Yup! To this day I still think of her as her character from VMarsI‚Äôve been going back and forth watching stranger things and VMars and let me just tell you as much as I love VMars the teen acting there is not nearly as impressive as Millie Bobby Browns tween acting. Ahhh! I just watched that vmars ep. I‚Äôm gearing up for the new episodes. blair waldorf too! vmars casting wildI forgot about all the antm folks in vmars.wow i would have started watching vmars way sooner if y'all told me tessa thompson's in s2 and is a stone cold bitch!!!i can't believe i actually got andy to stan vmars and leronica my biggest achievement i think! I- Never leave me. One of the biggest things I‚Äôm looking forward to in the near future is freaking out about the new VMars episodes with you. aw, is vmars your favorite? i‚Äôm rewatching it for the nth time so yes Hahaha I said the same thing once. btw VMARS is coming backTruly the strength of all things VMars is Keith/Veronica‚Äôs relationship which is exactly what makes me love it even when it‚Äôs not necessarily...great?It‚Äôs been long enough since I‚Äôve watched vmars that even though I remember the main beats of the season, I forgot some of the story of the week stuff. Who stole the from Logan‚Äôs poker game??? (Don‚Äôt tell me, I‚Äôm watching it now) WEAPONS OF CLASS DESTRUCTION is SUCH an important Vmars milestone though and often where I start watchingAnyways I need to go back on my vmars shit if I wanna finish the rewatch before season 4 I went straight from seeing it to seeing grand Budapest hotel. Saw VMars at the metreon, went to the amc in the mall for grand Budapest lmao I was wearing my kickstarter shirt I was R E A D Ysay hello to my vmars rewatch in order to get ready for the new seasonI need more Veronica Mars content on my tl please like this if you watch Veronica Mars and are excited for the new season in 2 weeks time and would die for Veronica and Logan so I can follow you!!  Ep 9 thoughts: Mom rolled her üëÄ at the exact moment Vmars said "I shouldn't roll my üëÄ and sighed as she said "I love Veronica." She's head over heels 4 her. It's so cute how much she loves her. this vmars reference... love that I have SO MANY THINGS TO SAY about the men dating underage girls thing. the newsletter will be üî• also I DEFINITELY had VMars-like crime dreams the first time I watched!I ended up jumping straight into VMars S2 anyway. I love these characters too much not to.milo being on vmars.... a dream a literal dreami don't like audiobooks but im willing to listen to the vmars ones just because it's her voice ugh I need to catch up on BLL this weekend but I should probs allot some time to VMars as well. I am concernedt that S3 will divide us (I remain staunchly Team Logan as well, but someone shows up to put that to the test...kind of like how in Gilmore Girls the fault lines tend to run more along Team Jess vs. Team Logan. Duncan is the Team Dean of VMars lol) listen LADIES vmars is an excellent program üëåüèΩYesdid i need a makeup remover because my fav vmars lines i‚Äôm so SMITTEN. the only good thing is that i discovered Tegan and Sara because of that song ending up on like every VMars fanmixYessss finally got to Mac's introduction on my VMars rewatch! Mac, still The Best.VMars S1E12. I watched a few without tweeting but the one about the secret society of smart ,rich dudes is too good. Twitter loves VMars! I still have to watch S2 and 3.VMars using a Tegan and Sara song for any scene involving Logan is cultural appropriationi think it would be nice if this time when i was rewatching vmars duncan died and lilly lived. just a thought. Maybe that's how Jamie Lee Curtis ended up in the VMars movieAs I continue the rewatch of I‚Äôm making some S4 predictions: Logan in couples counseling. Neptune grand got a great remodel. Wallace is an 09er now. Got to Ruskie Business in my VMars rewatch OH LORDT MY FEELINGS Literallyi think vmars and dcreek are the only fandoms that never have a debate on which ship in their show‚Äôs love triangle are better like everyone agrees that logan/veronica and joey/pacey are the only optionI really got my bf watching Veronica Mars to the point we just call it VM or VMars when we talk about it If you want a good GOOD seat, I'd start the day there (9AM) and move up as people leave after panels. We did that for the Timeless panel and we had fabulous seats, right up front by the mic. If you want to get in the room, I'd leave VMars at 12:30 and get in line by 12:45. I thought you were pulling an all nighter to watch vmars for vmarsOk I know the VMars episode where Tessa gets dunked in the dunk tank a lot is bad but also........,...........holy shit she certainly is a beautiful womanjel is still at the beginning of season one of vmars she deserves no rightsvmars the movie did what ayitl wishes it could do[VMARS SPOILERS] logan's mom k***** herself, his dad is a murderer who k***** his girlfriend and in the movie someone k**** his current girlfriend and tries to frame him...... he really can't catch a break huh jeeznot me going to rewatch the vmars movie at midnight :oi miss watching vmars can the revival be here alreadymy favorite part of vmars is when veronica and dad work together.... dads!3/3 Ep 8 thoughts: Mom watching VMars cry in her car: "Aww, she's always helping people + no one helps her. I wish I could give her a hug" Me: It's so unsettling watching her cry cuz she's usually so strong Mom: Strong people cry Me I dont want to push it but we know about the VMars Revival so i was wondering if you had any word on the rumored Angel reunion? Which would be fantastic! This is truly made my day also having been a huge Buffy/Angel fan as well. As far as loyalty goes it was my pleasure all such great shows, with great characters, and fantastic actors( such as yourself )to bring them to life. Same thing with ! Have a great week!Vase: As in Daze, with a V or Vase: As in Mars, again with a V (NO! Not VDaze, or VMars! That‚Äôs dumbass)I'm preparing for the new Veronica Mars series by reading the books. BTW, VMars and OITNB dropping on the same day is MADNESS.‚ÄúTonight we eat like the lower middle class to which we aspire‚Äù I finished season one of vmars so I'm watching the first episode of st3 now to cleanse my palateI‚Äôm in the middle of a S1 VMars rewatch to prepare for the new season and make my fun torture more bearable and I must report that Kristen Bell has not aged in like 15 years. 95 stays undefeatedCharisma Carpenter and Alyson Hannigan in the same scene god bless thank you VMarsOkay no more VMars as background noise for today so I'll leave you with one final note that will haunt me: Tad looks like Ramsay Snow.I've just ordered the two vmars books and Sex drive, hopefully it's good bc the article I read about it was interestingHad a dream about Logan Echolls...this is what happens when you rewatch vmars. If i only knew wtf VMars was... Sorry anyways(yeah, i had to revive the old name till monday, i attract Twitter Bans like my mater plants attract bugs VMars rewatch and izombie catchup. Then back to Supernatural rewatch/catchup Literally same. (Haven't watched VMars in years but it holds up so far!)I hope they have Norris Clayton back for the new season of VMARS. He was in the novels! (They should make more VMARS novels. THEY SHOULD HIRE ME TO WRITE SOME OF THEM.)No matter how many times I see the episode of VMars with Adam Scott and Leighton Meester, I am always shocked when LM calls him out in class and then again when the truth comes out lol.Adam Scott and Jessica Chastain are the superior VMars guest stars.I CAN HEAR SOMEONE STARTING A NEW (old) VMARS EPISODE!!! EXCUSE. Messing up my REWATCHbtw I need to rewatch vmars before the Hulu release but I don't think it's gonna happen Sometimes I think I'm too harsh on VMars but then I think it's like if they actually kept giving Firefly more seasons.the vmars bloopers i love this cast Vmars √© pequenininho, 3 temporadas s√≥I need to rewatch VMars ASAP Have either of y'all heard of We Used to Be Friends, btw? It's a pbta meant to emulate vmars. I picked up the ashcan foreeeever ago and never did anything with it is on I'm so excited! Also me: No Hulu in Canada :( Any chance Hulu will be available in Canada in time for the new season ?? Asking for a longgggg time fan of VMars! I am so sorry you had to go through life without VMars and LoVe. I take it you've started a VMars rewatch... VMars and Wallace not getting together There were so many people on VMars that are so recognizable now like... Ben Wyatt too üòÇ Idk if this is a bad take but you tweeting about vmars is just reminding me that dick can get it anytime.thinking about the vmars movie watching VMars from beginning wondering why Wallace moms didn't come to school after he was taped... I know random  Lmao Katy‚Äôs response to literally every question this weekend has been watch vmars (I mean it‚Äôs good advice vmars is great!) You‚Äôre welcome bitchwhen the new vmars episodes drop on hulu PLEASE don't spoil it all right away or at least put some decent warnings so you don't ruin for other people, thanks sitting here binge watching VMars for the 3rd time in my life and wondering where you‚Äôve been, friend! ü§î Hi Guys, I know that VMars Season 4 hasn't come out yet. But I don't think enthusiasm will be this high for Season 5 if Logan Echolls doesn't survive to the end of the season. It makes me so happy that so many people are doing a VMars rewatch.vmars the movie is just a leronica fanfic and i thank rob thomas for his serviceWhat if I just list ships I hate? That could be a fun game. I also don‚Äôt like VMars Piz. Nice? Check. A sweet man? Check. But he was written boring, he‚Äôs boring, kinda shame-y like that whole show. Sad about bad writing....This tweet brought to you by a gif of VMars and Logan Echols kissing. He‚Äôs not a good boyfriend, he‚Äôs just not.Okay. One more episode before I have to do things. VMars S1E9. Pulling off to puke when you realize you may have rounded bases with your half-brother‚Äîtotally appropriate.VMars S1E8. I missed a few because I was watching while reading earthquake twitter and cooking dinner for a friend. And she was gia goodman on vmars too!!! Yes the first two episodes. But VMars comes always in the way üòÇüòÇüòÇ I watched the first season of iZombie and loved it. But it‚Äôs really annoying to watch new episodes in German... I don‚Äôt like dubbing üòÖ how am i just now realizing Aarom Samuels was on vmars?? must have watched at least 10 timesVMars S1E5: Where Troy proves what an asshole he is. I feel the same way:) If you like VMars, consider checking out Wynonna Earp. Strong females, lots of solid plot writing, and badassery all around. I would recommend watching and then listening to the episodes of HOUSE and VMARS started around the same time, right? Were any other shows overusing the jaundice filters around that period?I just wanna go home and continue my rewatch of I don‚Äôt wanna work today even tho all I did yesterday was sleep and watch VMARS üòÇas she passes me in the vmars eps, i finally have an excuse to mute .... a miracle.... from heaven.... omg. omg. omg. you are?!?!?! we HAVE to talk more about this!! And yes, the latest Sims 4 expansion pack has MERMAIDS - it's a lot of fun. And yay VMars! Are you gonna watch season 4? I am so excite. I'm due for a VMars rewatch and movie rewatchOkay. VMars S1E4 while I wait to go to sleep until I‚Äôm sure people aren‚Äôt going to light my apartment on fire. i'd give anything to know whether it was vmars or scientology that made him take that down bc idk which is funniervmars put a gun to jason dohring's head and said you're going on social media or elsei finished 64 episodes of vmars + the movie in less than two weeks because I thought season 4 was out next week but it‚Äôs not out for three weeks i- Whoooo!!! I love VMars so, so much. ü§úüèΩüí•ü§õüèΩ5 episodes to finish vmars we sad[vmars spoilers i guess] lamb is dead and people on tv time are actually.... sad? and saying they're gonna miss him? do they forget that this is the man who laughed at veronica's face after she tried to report her r*** and victim blamed the girls at hearst who were r**** orHulu: wanna binge VMars bb? me: HELL YEAH LET'S GO also me: *owns the full series on Google Play* also also me: *owns the full series on DVD*VMars S1E3: watching one episode before I go into work this morning. When you‚Äôre the boss and people don‚Äôt finish their shit, you go in on holidays to finish it.vmars stop pushing logan away i begCrazy Arrested Mars: meets meets . VMars sings and dances her way through a murder mystery at Sudden Valley. Get your antidepressants and frozen bananas ready... and don‚Äôt forget Backup. watching for at least the 10th time. can't wait until VMars S1E2: oh god. This is the Paris Hilton episode, isn‚Äôt it? Almost finished with season 2! I'll probably rewatch them all again when I'm done! sick, i follow at least one other vmars fan, who is also an extremely oldschool luigi playermax greenfield on vmars was like...honestly a perfect specimen of a human beingA thing I really like about VMars is how it mixes serious crime and trauma with also like finding secret admirers and missing mascotsi have stayed up till 4 watching episode after episode of vmars and now i watch 2 and i'm tired.... wack I feel you will be happy to know that all the old VMars episodes are available to stream on Hulu nowBtw obviously I am not doing a VMARS rewatch binge before the new season comes out. That is definitely not a thing that is happening over this near-holiday weekend!! I am living for this thread. Talk to me about your VMars feelings.Which character do you resent having to see more on your VMARS rewatch?can the vmars scene packs people make a logan one i begVMars trivia: What‚Äôs the name of the search engine used in the Marsiverse? VMars rules. Watch s1, s2, and all of s3 until they start doing the stand alone eps at the end of that season. Movie...eh. I üíó Hannah too, OG person. She was a sweetheart who was good for him, but I do side with VMars on this one. üòâ I think I've never seen the pilot that aired on TV...We didn't have UPN, so I did all my VMars watching when the seasons came out on DVD...vmars was the first thing i saw on hulu and i thought it was for season four already and i almost hit play SO FAST Oh, to be you and fall in love with VMars for the first time!vmars also has my fav trope of like trauma bonded exes and friend groups who are ride or die still even if not on speaking termsMy fave episode is 'Weapons of Class Destruction'- essentially a love letter to Heathers and and Christian Slatet's genius performance. I'm kinda sad I stopped my keanu movie marathon, I need to start again but I can watch action once every three weeks or something and vmars is already covering with the drama/noir/mystery genre rnmizumono (hannibal) remedial chaos theory (community) the constant (lost) not pictured (vmars) ozymandias (brba) barbershop (atlanta) eps3.7dont-delete-me.ko ((but also all of s3))(mr robot) swan song (spn) tales of ba sing se (atla)Gonna start my nth re-watch of vmars. Still need a gif of "wha happen?" by Logan from the Halloween ep in season 3... You can never rewatch VMars too many times! I grew up in a beachy SoCal suburb full rich white surfer kids and plenty of weird murder scandals. VMars is like practically a documentary lmaoWatching on HULU and I‚Äôm crying. Crying from the story, crying from nostalgia genuinely crying over it all! Thank you thank you. Thank you for allowing me to binge this show!

I LOVE VMars (I'm watching it right now, actually) so I am very much "YES" but with the caveat that it's a murder mystery with a noir sensibility so there are deaths and there is real danger and there are multiple sexual assaults, so assess your own triggersi have twenty five days to rewatch vmars in preparation for the new season this is going to be fun for my eyesighttwo episodes to finish vmars season two and i know who blew up the bus but i still can't understand why so there's still some part of the big final reveal i can look forward to i guess revendo vmars e percebendo que a m√£e dela √© mais fdp do que eu lembravaHappy Vmars day!!!i don't know how it happens but between every time i rewatch vmars i manage to forget duncan existsi will never understand how vmars is this underrated, guess stan twitter just can't handle the ahead of its time excellence This is incredible.
