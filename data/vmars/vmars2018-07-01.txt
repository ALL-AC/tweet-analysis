2x22, like the s1 finale, is like watching a horror movie + it's so damn good + WALLACE LITERALLY DECKING THE GUY W THE GUN WAS SO STUPID BUT SO BRAVE :( school shooting/attempted shooting scenes tv make me so damn anxious. i forgot this show has one  I can dig it I can dig it You have a drinking problem I DID! I mean what a cap off on pride month really, let's get all the vmars ladies some moments to shine!love of my life from vmars is on this episode of criminal minds... amazing content. Agree with VMars and FNL. Dawson’s Creek season 3 and Gilmore S2 I think... buffy and vmars on point fyi The Veronica Mars fans didn't give up when the show got canceled. Fans wrote to Warner Bros to bring back VMars every month. 7yrs later, the show was revived by fans' donations. And now we got the series, movie, books, and hopefuly . We still haven't give up. The Leftovers 1-2. Every ep is layers upon layers of good storytelling, and it uses its soundtrack so well. Hard to beat. Also, VMars 1 Firefly. VMars season 1, Buffy seasons 3 and 5, West Wing seasons 1-4, Psych seasons 2-5 bro zamp u might be the most awkward person ik Awkward as my dog ate it i’m buhl fr Means Munn was in his pre Williamson days i would’ve never done that shut Yea i was upstairs tho but my names on the ceiling so that mines something Miss when you could do this to a house and not have a bitchin ass landlord up your assveronica blasting the dawson's creek theme and lying on the floor is a MOOD meg manning deserved so much better + i'll be bitter forever :(  A 5 o’clock work time is up UGH! I soooooo miss being an extra on VMars! You two were always dope AF and I am so happy for ALL of the success you have achieved since then 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 But Logan+VMars 4ever! (More mature take: Piz needs to be with someone more functional than Veronica.) I will! As soon as it’s up! 😉 VMars is one of my absolute favorites. I was into the movie, but the last season...not so much.vmars~ 1. 💖 logan echolls, veronica mars, lilly kane 💖 (s/o to wallace + jackie too!!) 2. LOGAN AND VERONICA 3. veronica wallace big time + veronica lilly 4. love!!! 5. i watched for the first time in 2010/2011? but i refound (i fell in love again) in 2014 Yessir in the hospital scene wit sly can’t wait💪🏼💪🏼 bsg, btvs, ats, vmars + oth!! This ISNT a still from VMars?!? I like how VMars did it and PLL has the excuse of being based off a book but Riverdale felt too overly broody Veronica Mars when I still watched. BtVS, VMars, TVD, iZombie, and way back when, it was a romance/sleuth show called PS.I luv u. starring Greg Evigan 😍 If you like Buffy or Dead Like Me at all I recommend the first season of VMars (the first season was the best by far). I rewatch every couple of years, for nostalgia and because I love Veronica so much. Not a fan of any of her love interests but Veronica herself is wonderful imo.
