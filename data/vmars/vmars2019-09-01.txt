 hey he got cut for a reason 🤷🏻‍♂️ one lucky team will scoop em up and have a nice second or third stringer Stats would prove that wrong. If you watched him run youd see hes not a scrub. He play with heart !! Its not like i said he was a top 5 back😂 just a great DEFINITELY underrated and unappreciated runningback he ran HARD and always fought for extra yards. what else are you asking for from a RB? He was definitely underappreciated. i never understood the hate i always thought he was a great runningback, a really hard runner On va aller sur vmars avec une fusée géate donc à l'intérieur il y a des légumes et fruit qui pousse dans la fusée et on va utiliser des inprimantes 3d pour faire des maison pour qu'on respire dedans et on va sur la plus haute montagne de mars et on plante un drapeau français A huge area. I learned a great deal by questioning basic assumptions on comms. An impromptu meeting with VMARS members proved tremendously useful with us all eagerly conversing. You can get overly focused on niche areas of kit, which are dragged out of context into factoid.4am and I move out of my hometown today but all I can think about is how dick cassablancas was stabbed in his first scene in the vmars rebootok i'm 10 min into vmars season 4 and i'm already spittingly furious with the script so that's fun Yes!! Love VMars growing up with Spy Kids, this book series, and VMars really had me believing I WAS a spy. I had a subscription to a spy kit thingy from Scholastic. Something came in the mail every 3 months 🔍 🎶private eyes 👀 they're watching you 👀 they see your every move 🎶For a show with a million on-the-nose names, you really outdid yourself with this one VMARSI keep thinking the Irish crime family in VMARS are named the McPoyles and I KNOW that’s wrong but it makes everything more funpretty sure Vmars should marry leo and ditch logan logan is the worst.Hmmm so we're into Episode 4 and basically every one has been set up to be a bad guy? EVEN MAYBE KEITH. I can't handle it. Is that the Vmars way?Imagine if Paramore's self-titled had been out when VMars first aired!! The soundtrack would have been so good!!!! Logan Veronica (VMars) Ethan Chandler Vanessa Ives (Penny Dreadful)With how he did it, his art suffered (S4 made no sense following S1 - 3 and the movie ). The fandom imploded (some were happy with it, some were unhappy with it but will take VMars any way they can get it, and some were furious. All, however, are passionate in their stance. 7/7¿Yo ya de dicho que que asco Vmars?I standby that having now rewatched vmars 1-3 and the movie so I can start the new season, and despite season 3 this show rules. I think mostly Logan getting blown up. Also the removal of the teen soap potion of the show and leaning 100% into Film Noir. Which, honestly I love. My love of VMars was always the Nancy Drew meets Sam Spade kinda deal. I’m on board but could you imagine the Internet? They’re salty as it is. I’d really love to see it. Plus Eleanor was into Simone, so by the transitive property VMars should be into Nicole.Terminada de ver Vmars S4 Y... ¿Por qué?Finished Queer Eye in my parade of random shows to get through. On to Season 4 VMARS (it was that or Handmaid's Tale). Dang, Logan, you old. Also I never thought you were cute or nice, homie. I’ll take all the unwanted merch! I LOVE VMars and am sooooooo grateful they even gave it the time of day. Send yo merch here I’ll keep it! For anyone wondering if the ending if Vmars is lazy... ***SPOILER ALERTS*** Go hit up the finale of iZombie and play "spot the similarities BINGO" - just saying 🤔I’m starting the new s if adult vmars. I am not expecting much in the way of writing past wrongs, but maybe to break even on enjoyment?Eliza Coupe with that undercut in VMARS s4 🤩 oh Seanan did a thread on VMars? *grabs popcorn* *settles in* For the record, I'm not happy with a lot of things in S4, and I have no intent of watching any more VMars. I whined a little, but I'm not sending hissy fit letters and making demands and sending them my merch. Suck it up, buttercup. At the end of the day, it's just a show. I finally started listening to your podcast because I need your thoughts on PWB (obsessed — I have watched Crashing, it’s eh) and MORE of your opinion on VMars which I greatly appreciated on PCHH. 💗Anyone else think there should be a themed parody of 's "Thank You, Next" recounting all of the classic exes? Looking at you . 😉🎤🎼 i’ve been reading vmas as vmars all day it basically boils down to VMars being in two "modes": film noir detective, when she is a fallible character, and revenge fantasy wish fulfillment, when she is infallible. it's kind of complex, which is why i nixed trying to tweet thread itok I have a lot of thoughts about VMars but it's too much for a Twitter thread. so, to be continued.⚠️SPOILER ALERT⚠️ If you are a VMars fan and have yet to watch the newest season, skip past my next thread... me and my bf watched vmars together as teens when we first started dating!! when the new one came out it was like we came full circle and it was so nice 😭💕 Nevermind send your vmars ware to whomever. I did not hate the season as much as you, then again I'm not running people off of social media over a show either. No the point is not being missed nor over my head. The point is you want them to know you are disappointed, but waging war via social media didn't work, neither will sending back your vmars stuff. I'm sorry.not a single vmars edit in two days rip I just finished that audiobook. Agree. Wish there were more of the books (in addition to more from Hulu), I’ll take Vmars in whatever form. That the same guy who did The Mindy Project's amazing costume design is responsible for VMars terrible 90s costumes aesthetic will always be nuts.Yorgunluk atayım, neșem yerine gelsin diye VMars izleyeyim dedim. Finali ağzıma sıçtı. Öyle final olur mu Allahsız ? 5.sezonu çekmeyin hikaye böyle bitsin.the theme song for vmars s4 is boring i miss the s1 versionSomething's been on my mind watching this season about the two modes that VMars (show and character) work in, putting it on the back burner until I finish the season.Something I like about VMars S4 is that it confirms that yes, Big Dick is the kind of dad who would actively torture his son. Didn't quite get that vibe in S3. What an absolute fuckhead. in s1 he’s still pretty marble-mouthed (not as deep as in vmars but it’s still There) and by the end of the show his whole Thing is like overpronouncing everythingKBell is SO DISTRACTINGLY PREGNANT in the VMARS movie omgFiiiiinally finished VMARS s3. Upon the rewatch, I think I can safely say Logan has fallen off my list of favorite problematic faves ☹️ Loving your work on S4 VMars so far. Not too many episodes in, but you are friggin hilarious!holy crap VMars even brought back Tim Foyle?? lmao i always forget he's the dean's murderer, every rewatch I'm like "wait WHAT" Wait i read this wrong. I really was lost i didn’t know my location Honestly only God knowsThankful for i honestly would’ve probably been lost without youi just finished vmars season 4 i’m not going to editorialize for fear of spoiling. so enjoy this announcement i guess People are real loud on the internet but everyone I know is still a marshmallow. Keep making VMars please! I’ll never forgive her for what she did to season 4 of VMars. Rob wrote it but she co-signed and agreed Exactly, and it's not okay. PTSD, anxiety, depression - they're illnesses and deserve compassion and care, always. I don't understand how you can watch VMars and claim to be a fan of a character who's had similar struggles, and be this callous and cruel.everything i’ve read and seen (so far) of season 4 of vmars makes me so sad and wish it had never been rebooted again in the first place...apparently angst is the only thing that keeps things watchable.Character limits wouldn’t let me go in depth with how much I love idioceacy, parenthood, VMars and the good place as well as when you got her to see a sloth for her bday and your taste challenge on Ellen. Keep be awesome. You guys are goals.Tengo dos planes para la tarde... 1 es hacer gifs mientras termino Vmars... El otro hacer gifs mientras convenzo a de seguir con Shameless.. IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME WATCHING VMARS?? I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU! It’ll raise the question of when or if it gets international distribution, like VMars, but seems the likely play. Neptune folks. He said that specifically during a group interview where you were sitting behind him. I wish you all the best in ur career but face it - VMars is over for you as well. vmars back in the day was one of the many shows that helped me with my depression, so for him to mock someone, he truly doesn’t understand what tv shows and movies are about, at least to me. It runs in the fam veins to roast each other Stop trynna put me on blast Start what 🤔 I don’t condone that ChilllllHell yeah the ending to VMARS hurt. It helped me get through a really really tough time. Isn’t that what all forms or art are for? I can’t respect anyone that mocks people for using shows as a healthy “escape”.MAYBE ILL FUCK AROUND AND REWATCH VMARS AFTER MINDHUNTER HMMMMdamnnn the dudes cut dicks head off, im when did vmars get this dark 😳on the season 4 finale of vmars, man i ain’t readyLet's watch the 4 season of Vmars and hate the show forever. vmars or old grey’s Sick. What would you say is, like, I guess the 'theme' of the show? I know the conceit of the show, but what kind of stuff is it trying to illuminate? I need to watch Legion + VMars S4 when I get back to the States and trying to figure out how to prioritize :) Thanks for that VMars rec! It was well worth reading. I love a story that comes full circle like that. These interviews make me as a fan feel like a burden for “preventing” them from telling the “true” story they always wanted to tell. I always thought we were on the same page for wanting more VMars, but now I just feel like an idiot. I went from absorbing every VMars article I could find, geeking out with other fans, and being so excited for more to now not even caring about the show and that is such a bummer. It's all based on your reasoning for killing Logan. It is such a disappointment. We buying the new COD insteadthat vmars finale got me sobbing like a lil bby 😭😭toda vez que vejo algo de vmars na tml bufo de ódio I remember the extended intro bc I was introduced to VMars in the middle of season 2 so I just went out and got the DVDs. So I obviously had to check on hulu and holy crap it seriously isn't there! LOVE the podcast and can't wait for more :)Yeah ok DEFINITELY do not watch VMars S4vmars movie here we gooo Yes. I am bad. I have been avoiding last episode of vmars bc I cant handle the cry... Been there done that!! Still can’t believe I didn’t watch this when it was on. I was in my first year of college when it premiered!! So up my alley!! I even dressed like VMars!! Thanks for info! Just roll with it. vmars fans get all the time. Ps i never said anything about the fandom. I’m one of the many that hates what happened to my show, but to whoever runs the VMars social accounts I AM SO SORRY because I know you don’t have any say in the story.so anyway 0.5% of an apology to vmars s4, time zones are hardbeen talking a lot of crap about vmars s4 and 99.5% of it I stand by BUT I just realized I've been planning for days to share a ride tomorrow from the San Diego airport with someone who's arriving three hours after me. The time is right if I stay in EST in California!...but...i forgot the vmars theme song changed a little bit for s3.... thanks i hate itme: rewatching vmars before i subject myself to s4 is a great idea me on 2x20: hmmmmm i hate thisfavorite season of vmars? 💗🍬  we're watching VMars right now but I put on WW when my wife isn't home and I have work to do. We finished Parks before VM and after is Legend of Korra and then BSG. I was upset and furious when I watched it but OH BOY did I get even more mad when I read the Rob Thomas interviews about -why- it -had to- happen. Such utter bullshit, sexist reasons!!! VMars went from my favorite show to one I'm ashamed to recommend.should i do more vmars polls? finish vmars then parenthood 🤪 Ohhh man, VMars revival was a dumpster fire of ableism, mental health stereotypes, racist BS against Latinos and then a classic fridging because married women are boring and Rob Thomas wants Veronica "broken" and "sexually available". I wish I was joking. Breaking fans, not easy to achieve. VMars did it. My poor heart! It really is. Like when How I Met Your Mother ended like it did (which was A LOT WORSE than s4 of vmars) None of the fans disowned the show they just ignored the episodes that did them wrong. Guess 2013 was a simpler time. is dead to me now. Weak reasoning for the ending, cuss off about getting rid of teen drama. Marriage between 2 messed up people isn't teenage anything. Goodbye VMars, I knew "darker season" was a risk for GoT bullshit and mental health damage, but di ko pa ren nawawatch ung vmars tehh kaya ko ba aigoo TTTalking to about early seasons Vmars and getting overwhelmed w my appreciation of Logan/his arc AGAIN FINISH VMARS FIRSTOnce im done with oitnb back to vmars 🤷🏽‍♀️ way to kill Logan you jerk hopefully i can finish jtv by next week and then vmars once my fall semester starts ahhhi need to finish jtv and vmars too....i literally have no time fhdjkhfjdRefusing to watch the season 4 finale of until I know for *certain* it’s getting renewed for season 5...but I can’t hold out much longer...so can and the cast please decide to renew it already? Pleaseeee 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 uhhh this episode definitely just opened with We Used To Be Friends and I really froze for a second lmao I had to double-check that I was watching the oc and not vmars by accident somehow come back, I miss you live tweeting vmarsjust remember about that one scene in vmars were leronica are making out and a breathe me remix is playing in the background I'm still muddling through this VMars x Pitch story or I'd consider it eu tenho questões com vmars (em que: eu odeio o ship) mas esse texto foi sensacionalThe VMars S4 titles have made me a S3 titles convert, otherwise very into this first ep so far
