Very VMars of her. one thing i’m quite happy about is that i’m able to watch vmars without any subtitles, and i thought this would mean i’d have to concentrate or something but actually after some minutes i completely forget they’re not here and i understand everything smoothlywhat’s a tv show you loved but would never ever rewatch? for me it’s vmarswhen i finish love island uk s5 imma go back to my vmars watch thread"So this is how it is. The innocent suffer. The guilty go free. And truth and fiction are pretty much interchangeable. There is neither a Santa Claus nor an Easter Bunny, and there are no angels watching over us.Things just happen for no reason and nothing makes any sense."
