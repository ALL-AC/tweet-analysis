a ver se acabo hoje a 2a temporada de vmarsex oomf really blocked me over me spoiling vmars ugh grow upso vmars let me down and tomorrow i have to say goodbye to jtv :(( i want the vmars pops first pls finish vmars first I like that he beat the shit out of Piz because he thought he recorded VMars w/o her permission, like okay chivalry isn‚Äôt dead it just doesn‚Äôt exist out of a world Rob Thomas wrote. I just assumed this thread was about VMars even tho it didn‚Äôt name it lolDon't call myself a , but I'm v. disappointed in s4 for many reasons well beyond the last 10 minutes. But I've gotten a lot of joy healing from VMars over the years. I'm angry at the poor job done by the producers on many fronts. I'm .I think a lot of people miss the ultimate message of a lot of , which isn't "we would never watch VMars without Logan" but instead "if you have to kill him, do it right and do it well and don't do it for misogynistic reasons." We got none of those. VMars- Is it on any of the streaming?a cena de vmars da kristen bell cantando no scrubs √© perfeitajust thought about the ending of vmars and I‚Äôm sad again i already started umbrella academy and i heard vmars has a pretty shit deathI've slept on it... TWICE... and I'm still mad about the ending of s4...  Rewatch the last episode and truly pay attention to Veronica s face... If u know vmars than you should know she will avenge...and, wouldn‚Äôt you know it, Piz‚Äôs hair in the VMars movie was exactly my hair goals in 2014But the knife in my heart is that there could have been so much more and now it‚Äôs been traded for what the hell ever Rob Thomas envisions that feels suddenly NOT like the show I cared about. So, it‚Äôs with finality and regret that I say goodbye to VMars and company.I‚Äôm so afraid of what the ending will be now that VMars has come out  you realize you responded to one of the best current VMars fanfic writers there is, right? Someone who has written *amazing* piece after *amazing* piece in this fandom. Being the change we want to see doesn't give a pass for the travesties we're dealt to not be addressedeither i'm too lazy or too traumatized by vmars or bothi don't think i'm ever gonna be able to rewatch vmars Off the top of my head ( this is only VMars): 1: Veronica, Mac, Wallace 2: Logan, Veronica, Weevil (figuring out who actually killed Felix, for example) 3: Veronica, Logan, Dick 4: Veronica, Keith , Cliff Shall I go on?vmars twt is really just begging for the venom at this point. it's hilariousUgh - just got spoiled on vmars season 4...definitely not watching it. 2 are Veronica and Wallace from Veronica Mars and 3 are Finn and Jake from Adventure Time. I highly recommend VMars for Buffy fans--lots of guest stars from the Buffyverse and it balances coming-of-age with noir detective stories instead of vamps! ü§©Just finished season 4 of . The jury's out on whether I'm still a . A part of me will always be, but I just feel that this was completely unneccessary. How is it character development to force V back into her shell?  he won't be happy until he burns everything to the ground I guess! but from what I've read online, it seems fandom wont' be happy til they burn his career to the ground, so good luck fandom! tbh the vmars fandom is one I wouldn't mess with, they mobilize get shit doneMe, watching VMars and seeing the tea in the Mars Investigations break room: Well, if you stopped shelling out for Harney and Sons tea, maybe you'd be in slightly better financial shape! ok, i'm with you on the "no more VMars," but the "We all/women deserve better stories?" I'm good. I was just mad Logan died since he was my favorite character. Hi. I am desperately going to need you to stop binging all the other seasons of VMars and just get to season 4 now. Thanks and have a great dayit‚Äôs so sad how excited i was for vmars and now i have to pretend it never happenedthe truth is i started vmars last week and i got progressively mad thinking about what happens at the end. i haven‚Äôt finished it yet, don‚Äôt even know if i willme watching every ep of vmars: would this really happen? or is that the point?I want to enjoy that major and liv scene but after VMars season four I have no trust. They better not be setting this up to kill major! S4 VMars barely resembled who we've loved supported for years--one who looked for the good as much as the bad, was learning growing herself, fought alongside friends family for a better world. A woman of compassion hope despite her thorns. She is, afterall, a marshmallow.Like early vmars was really interesting and positive about women dealing with trauma and stuff but V‚Äôs disdain of therapy and like healthy relationships lasting into her 30s is not a great model I disagree about the movie but I‚Äôm willing to have an open mind about the finale. What I dislike is based on interviews w/ Rob it seems like this is mostly to reframe the show as detective mystery only and I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a VMars we‚Äôll recognize. ‚ÄúHi im Mike and I‚Äôm a Marshmallow. It‚Äôs been, wow its been four full days since my last VMars episode.‚Äù Support group of et al ‚ÄúHi, Mike‚Äùi rlly started vmars just to see miss tessa thompson and then lost interest as soon as i got to her season, peak dumbass My face is all poofy and I won‚Äôt get back these wrinkle free eyes...I completely understand and respect your decisions for this season. You better let them make it up to us with some new and exciting mysteries! Thoughts on VMars 2 minutes in: 1) The opening credits are awesome and the song is still, in fact, terrible 2) So that's how they'll avoid saying fuck 3) There's only 3 main credited actors üò≥ 4) Veronica's still fucking got it 5) If you take away Daddy Mars I will riot.I just need a vmars s4 6ch download but it‚Äôs nowhere to be found noooooo üò≠üò≠ (I finished the new season of vmars over the weekend)was the vmars reboot worth it? GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH A BIG FAT NOPEStarting my vmars rewatch finally even though I know the devastating death in season four üò≠ worse. 100 times worse. idk if you've ever watched VMars before so I don't wanna spoil it for you, but it's akin to having your favorite Rory boy eliminated in the biggest WTF just happened moment ever. Redux "Take a Break" from Hanilton but for your VMars Fandom. Um all of us dont think you nailed it.... I love as a human but I seriously think doesnt care about the fans who have been supporting this show for years by the way he ended the show.... deserved better  where is the wife and kid from the Vmars movie... The devils in the Details  watching season IV of VMARS why aren't you a Mechanical engineer  Also if I ranked the seasons, season 4 comes in second after season 1. (For me it goes 1, 4, 2, 3 ... ... all VMars fan fiction ever ... movie.)So, about that Veronica Mars s4 finale. I'm officially dead inside. So sad about VMars that I started watching Bake Off...againSomething big got spoiled for me on VMars Season 4 and now I don't want to watch the rest (I've only seen the first three episodes) but I know I should. Please convince me.Comecei a ver a S04 de VMars depois de pegar um spoiler horroroso do final e terminei o 1¬∞ ep puta da caraI can't believe the new VMars got JK Simmons?!?!we goin ‚úà last episode vmarsI just finished vmars. (You won't, if you're watching it for the first time in 2019 and not 2004, IMO.) VMars does a lot of interesting and strong things with class, race, gender, sex, and violence for being a show from 2004... but Logan is a very 2004!Teen Show Bad Boy. The only intrstng Logan was s4.I finally finished VMars s4 and I have so many feelings and most of them are: 1. I'm so sad 2. I want all the new chars to come back 3. I love it so much 4. I'm so sadstarted watching veronica mars in early june. then season 4 came out. crazy world we live in. long live VMars Very excited for this VMars ending because so far this season is amazing (just finished ep4)I'm more annoyed with the end of The Boys than the end of VMars! I'm glad I'm not attached to VMars else I'd be fuming so fucking hard LMFAO we don‚Äôt want vmars without Logan. Thought you should know üôÉ Ive got VMars issues.Just finished Stranger Things 3. First VMars and now this. üòû give my poor heart a break VMars was GOODok if this is an actual ***** *** *** ***** ***** on top of everything else this season i s2g i think i'm done with vmars. this is a whole ass mess ://vmars season three really is...something else isn't it The best thing about is finding my people after 10 years of life without VMARS yes, like he's too lazy/insecure to just write a new show so he's using vmars and us instead what a shitheadreading tumblr reactions to vmars s4 and yeah having similar thoughts. :////and vmars is kind of an anomaly in a lot of ways because of the kickstarter and the movie, so truthfully, fan entitlement is validated here. but still, how could rob thomas be SO out of touch with what the fans actually liked about this show?The VMars I fell in love with was one who was well-rounded. She was more than her relationship with her father, or her love life, or her developing friendships, or even the mysteries she solved. Her sum was much greater than her parts... but she still had to have parts to sum up! KB fundraises for NKH regularly so it made sense to partner with VMars. It‚Äôs too bad they didn‚Äôt get looped in with the release change so people would‚Äôve at least felt better when they watched it one time that something was going to charity. Not many want to watch it again.people screaming at the vmars instagram account like.... you know it‚Äôs just some intern who runs that right? robb thomas isn‚Äôt reading this shit.Me: Who's the Aimee Mann soundalike doing the VMars theme song? Friends...it's Chrissie Hynde. Yeah for sure! VMars is uhhhh a real mixed bag when it comes to queer rep, but this episode you‚Äôre on is pretty goodi really need a new show to obsess over but i also don't feel like anything will fill the vmars shaped hole in my hearti am WILDLY horny for this VMars S4 spoiler i just read i can't believe they went there i'm thrilledI love Jason way too much to want him back on VMARS after they did him like that I know it‚Äôs an unpopular opinion but I don‚Äôt want Jason back on vmars after they did him dirty. They don‚Äôt deserve him if I‚Äôm being honest The ridiculous commercials are honestly insane! (Part of why I never signed up for before the VMars revival). And you are correct. Beautiful cast, no talent. ü§£ But I can't help but LOVE IT.omg the long drive home over the bridges in the vmars was shot in my hometown love thatsomeone please write me the fic of my choice in vmars fandom I have very specific requests and no time to write it myself I‚Äôm very interested in how Logan went from flying planes to AHEM....possibly a spook please I could write this but also I can‚ÄôtOK. A little let-down by this new Vmars. Not finished...but wtf. Seen too may people without heads/heads without bodies. help? I‚Äôm refusing to watch it cause I‚Äôve been spoiled and don‚Äôt wanna ruin my found memories of vmars Are you watching vmars without me!listening to the vmars intro song and wanting to die Any suggestions on what to watch next? VMars used to be my go to when I needed comfort.this new vmars intro is some true detective shit I always feel like the odd one out when it comes to my VMars opinion lol. I've always hated when the show spends too much time on her and Logan or her and Piz. I just want her solving good cases. But I do wish there was more stuff with her and her dad or her and her friends.done with vmars and it did not fail me. still one of the best üôåI forgot Justin Long did a guest on the VMars movie!  And ‚ÄúChuck‚Äù will always be one of my favorites cause, just like the classic VMars, it has everything a good show needs: good comedy, compelling romance and action. The ending is open to interpretation but it won‚Äôt leave you distraught.Veronica: Come on.. ruined lives, blood shed? Do you really think a relationship should be that hard? Logan: No one writes songs about the ones that come easy  I found the mystery.... not great. So if vmars season 5 is about the mystery. Yikes.i always wanted a pushing daisies revival but after VMars came back i realize i‚Äôm probably just asking for heartbreak done for shock value, no thanks You too pop Definitely Back on Degrassi my boss said one of the characters she‚Äôd helped create had Logan Echols as a touchstone. Revisiting VMars s1, I totally get it.K I have finally stopped being so blue over - but this recent izombie episode is making me think we're going to have some more mourning coming up. I'm not sure I can do a round 2. is the chaotic bisexual vmars jacket worth tax penaltiesmy roommates both going out of town the weekend i need to finish this vmars essay is true allyshipMy gripe so far in the new VMars is that it‚Äôs lit like The Good Place shot like Parks and Rec... I want my smooth shots in sepia, babyyyI'm gonna rewatch the first 3 seasons of vmars now cause tbh I forgot everything and I need to see it with fresh adult eyesI don't......Hate the ending of the new VMars.......but I'm not entirely sure I want to consider it all canon...........I'm gonna say it all ended at the movie and this is some fan fiction......... Have YOU actually read the reasons? Seen Jason call out Kristen and Rob for not bothering to show on set on his last day? Seen him in tears over this as they hide from social media? Are you cool with a VMars with no Keith, Wallace, Weevil, anyone else? THAT was the reason. That is a fantastic way to describe that feeling. Not that I've watched VMars. But I'm still tracking with you like YES I'M THERE.alright i watched the first two episodes of vmars and i am tired now. also i love logangonna go watch parks and rec now so I can forget about this fucking vmars endingvmars spoilers//// It's really a wildly bad vmars vibe that logan grew up while veronica did not :/ I find you to be rather arrogant about your choice to kill our beloved Logan. They can have lives outside of eachother BUT STILL HAVE EACHOTHER. I will not participate in any VMars future - there isn‚Äôt one without him.Piz‚Äôs hair on VMars was exactly my hair goals in 2007I JUST FINISHED THE NEW SEASON OF VMARS (finally) AND ROB THOMAS CAN EAT A BAG OF DICKS. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. is that.... josh duhamel I literally posted that because the only opinions we are seeing is the dissent. And have stated mult. times to centralize. Pick one spot focus there unite with like minding people stop hijacking every VMars mention. It is overwhelming. And obnoxious.vmars oomfs block me now i deserve itI‚Äôm rewatching VMARS. Am I a. Season four was perfect. Can't wait to see VMars tackle some more intrigue beyond Neptune. PS: Logan never was "the one".If not for one spoilery line by Logan, VMars 4 would be a great starting point for folks who cant handle the early 2000s overdramatic-ness of the first season- just saying!!!!!I‚Äôm going to restart VMARS from the beginningüòúüòúalso just realised izombie technically came out yesterday but that just means that ep should have aired before the hot mess that was the vmars final and so i think my ridiculous point is still valid also if any writers do need to somewhat kneel at the feet of their audience it‚Äôs the veronica mars writers given that it‚Äôs a very small show with a cult following whose fans literally funded an entire movie for them lsadfkjads like vmars does not have casual viewersI‚Äôm going to be honest...I don‚Äôt want Logan back on vmars because they don‚Äôt deserve Jason lmaoOh it looks like the VMars showrunner is doubling down on the terrible s4 decisions? Cool cool cool cool all the more season to avoid s4 entirely.I‚Äôm only one episode into VMars s4 and I‚Äôm pretty sure I know what happens in the finale. Thanks, Twitter. You were really ahead of the game on this one.THIS IS LIKE VMARS ALL OVER AGAIN NO GOD NO ahhh no :(( and yes omg i‚Äôm almost to s3 of vmars and then i‚Äôm gonna die when it gets to s4 so be ready for my breakdowns!! ;) but then i‚Äôll let izombie put me back togetherüò©oh this jesse dude was in vmars I am so beyond sick of the people who hated the ending popping up on every single VMars post and whining. We get it you hated it stop fucking up every single mention. Every VMars post from anyone is so full of vitriol. Move on. Signed a LoVe fan from the original air dateWatching the OG VMars episodes I hate to love Logan b/c hes so toxic but 2019 Logan WENT TO THERAPY!!! So proud of my boy, no more guilt loving the shit out of him!!!!!I have to watch the new season of VMars tmrw bc I‚Äôm seconds away from seeing a spoiler and I think I already know what happened.I haven't written VMars since pre-movie and am working with a brain injury so, you know, be kind. LOL I write a ton of fic these days, if that's also your jam, as well as some fic. Season 4 told us that strong women need to be single. cant have a husband and be strong and determined sorry this married mother of 2 went to school and worked full-time.. We can do it all.  Yes yes yes. I love VMars. Unsure how I feel of S4 though. I think I am still reeling and trying to process. I haven't written for VMars since 2014 and I'm 10 pages into my fix-it. This will be the only silver lining in the shitshow: excellent fix-it fics that prove Rob's a lazy writer....and I'd better show I've earned it by listing how hard I've worked so now I get to wear my Namaste In Bed tee and show off my homemade cold brew while I binge VMars. There is also some interesting commentary to be had about where TV has gone since VMars was on originally and some of the contrast between seasons 1-3 versus the bingeable-hulu version that we are seeing now.finished ssn 4 of VMars last night and WOW this was a densely plotted season -- really liked the relash btwn JK and Keith They already lost a good 3k followers just from yesterday. I took a screenshot cause I was wondering about the fallout. But hey, why not unfollow also while we're at it. Her interviews have been very disloyal to the fans who like it or not kept VMars going.Should I spend too much money on the Joan of Arc necklace from Veronica Mars (even though I‚Äôm currently feeling very conflicted about my beloved VMars...)VMars season 4 was good sorry bout iti just started s3 of my vmars rewatch which would‚Äôve been PERFECT IF THE NEW EPS HADNT RELEASED A WEEK EARLY THANKS KRISTEN BELLI do not care for the new theme for VMars. I know the story behind why Mac wasn‚Äôt featured. My comments are more directed at . I am disappointed with some of the choices made in this season. Veronica Mars is certainly the protagonist but the supporting characters are integral to the experience as well.listen, kevin smith said the soap-operatic elements of vmars never interfered with/were better than the mysteries and if kevin smith says it, it must be trueHi you threw my tv schedule out the wazoo w/ an early release of VMars. Can I have 4 Weddings tomorrow to rebalance?üôèüèªüë∞üèΩSeason 3 Vmars. Let's do this!One ep of new VMars left, but I know is the killer and I‚Äôm stoked for that ending.I LOVE KBell but I think that she thinks that Veronica Mars is the perfect female role model...... VMars can be a great role model but my GOD is she a hugely flawed character, and KBell's lack of acknowledgement of that is concerning.....What show should I binge next? Because if I don‚Äôt think of something soon I‚Äôll probably end up rewatching vmars It‚Äôs not just about Logan. Like literally he is isolating her from EVERYONE and that‚Äôs just not the show..... he said he wanted to model the revival after some other detective shows but V can be grown up and it still be VMARS. That‚Äôs why I feel like the ending is a big F U.I‚Äôm really sad that I won‚Äôt be able to watch vmars for the first time ever againI‚Äôm supposed to believe vmars s3 ended like that and veronica got back with logan starting off s4 years later like this?? bitch gtfo WHAT HAPPENED TO MY MAN PIZNormalmente reviro meu olhos para peti√ß√µes por causa de s√©ries mas vi uma no charge para mudar o final do epis√≥dio 8 de VMars e fiquei muito tentada a assinar. Mesmo ainda n√£o tendo visto nem o primeiro ep. Meu cora√ß√£o j√° est√° muito quebrado com o spoiler e a coragem n√£o vem. He must have thought VMars fans wouldn't eat his ass up like GoT fans did DD. It was SO arrogant. For them to release it a week before it was intended AND spent the entire time promoting LoVe like they did? HAHAHA. Good luck with that S5 and viewership. ATLA and VMars are the best. (No spoilers for VMars) I‚Äòm sure there would be plenty of guest appearances. I truly love VMars and also was sold on that very old FBI-Pilot that was made many many years ago but never accepted. I feel the story needs to evolve outside of Neptune so I kinda understand that big changes would be happeningWow I literally and truly blocked the S3 VMars opening credits from my mind, I can't believe they had something so good and ruined it so thoroughly thank you for these! I think I'm going to write one this weekend, a fix-it. (I've written for other fandoms but not VMars before) I need to know if you finished VMars. I‚Äôm not mad about VMars but Harlots lost me this seasonIM JUST SAYING IF THE PEOPLE BEING SHITTY ABOUT SEASON FOUR PREVENT ME FROM GETTING MORE VMARS I WILL BE HIDEOUSLY FURIOUS.The VMars fandom is making me so fucking angry right now. Sorry you clearly never understood the show or cared for it beyond your ship. You‚Äôre literally just crying ‚Äúbad writing‚Äù because something you didn‚Äôt like happened. It‚Äôs not bad writing. You‚Äôre just an idiot. Yeah we were watching the new VMars season and he did an evil cackle and Brynna said ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs a Batman villain now‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúWAIT‚ÄùI was in a lot of ways disappointed with the fourth season of Veronica Mars. They reduced our favourite characters to a single dimension where they had no lives or feelings outside of Veronica. And that ending...*sigh*. S4 didn‚Äôt feel like VMars How about making some Veronica Mars Pop! Vinyls? It‚Äôs been 15 years with 3 seasons, 1 fan-funded .7 million dollar movie, 2 books, and a Hulu revival. A loyal audience proven to spend their money on VMars? Sounds like a sure thing. ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è Honestly, WR is an even MORE 1:1 example of VMars‚Äôs influence on my writing. Angry social outcast investigates circle of career bullies to find a killer?? Check and check. if you read comments on the official vmars account you will see that the majority of people are out. but keep telling yourself that only 2 people didn't like it if it makes you feel better.Fell asleep while watching VMars w/ then stayed up too late to watch what I missed and now I‚Äôm consumed by THOUGHTS. I would LOVE to work on a VMars book with you! Exactly. If his goal was to just write something that allowed him to "crank out" more mysteries I don't think he should have called it Veronica Mars. Vmars is at least 50% about character relationships and development- the good stuff.Vendo VMars e s√≥ consigo pensar: o Jason Dohring fez bichectomia?y'know i really was going to watch vmars some day but uh idk if i will now I just want to counter all the angry opinions here say I loved the new seasons. The ending was tragic but after reading the explanation of why I get it look forward to seeing what comes next for VMars bc at the end of the day the shows about her she‚Äôs who I watch forThat moment when your favourite TV series returns to a fourth season after 14 years. Can you imagine that?  Well notJagath, that‚Äôs just the protocol when one finds another VMars fan This makes sense. I also might want to read VMars as more critical on this point than it actually is, just because I like it.I'm watching VMars and like... Why is Echolls so... bighonestly fuck vmars s4! what the fuck was that ending !i‚Äôm truly so annoyed bc i was getting right to the good part of s2 of vmars before the revival and now i don‚Äôt even wanna finish rewatching!! men ruin everything!!! Most of Hulu shows do it. I wish VMars had. :((Not what happened in VMars but I do feel utterly betrayed by Rob Thomas!).üò≠üò≠ vmars finale ep why you do this üò≠üò≠Jfc people retweeting major VMars spoilers. Can you notI‚Äôll be home alone for 2 wks so I think I‚Äôll restart VMARS so I can cry in peaceI forgot how quickly VMARS veers from rape to incest in the span of about 20 seconds üò¨I really hope we get to go back to Neptune at some point. This is the rare show revival that actually is just as good as the original seasons and I want more VMars. Spoilerüö®- WTF??Why can‚Äôt V get a happy ending just ones? Why did it had to end this way? I‚Äòm ashamed to say this (because I love Keith), but I rather have K sick than Logan dead üòûüò¢ Still love the show, but this hurts üòû here!! Not my VMarsnow i‚Äôll never know what vmars s4 character i am :/ As much as I loved the new season, I HATED that Veronica was like that. I actually got pissed at her for being so dismissive about therapy. Like Logan needs to be free of his demons, VMars, no need to put down his need for self-care! i'm annoyed at her because she's acting like literally nothing is happening and that she hasn't lost 99% of her vmars fanbaseI WANT HER TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT VMARS BUT SHE'S JUST LIKE lin manuel mirandaüíóüíûüíòüíòüíóüíûüíòüíóüíû dogsüíìüíòüíóüíìüíóüíìüíòüíóüíì This year has been so bad for tv for me. First The Magicians and now VMars. :( Amiiiiiiiga, to indo na psic√≥loga mas vem buscar VMars quando voc√™ quiser ap√≥s 16hOf course it‚Äôs times like these that I remember that I only ever rewatch S1 and I rage quit S3 3 episodes in and I only ever get excited about VMars news by pretending that S3 didn‚Äôt happen.ok this is my last VMars tweet today and completely unrelated to my feelings on the stupid finale twist but is Dick Casablancas okay? He lost his dad and his best friend in the span of like 30 hours.. Also a good choice! GG has over 100 episodes so it‚Äôs harder to get through than Stranger Things. I want you, Gabe, and Cece to finish VMars with me because the new season is incredible!!oh shit lemme watch the pearson pilot i completely forgot about it because of vmarsShout out to the awkward plug for another Hulu show in VMars ep. 4, I think. (Also, forever a pet peeve when characters watch a show and just start mid-episode. üò∂)it's a new day and i'm still pissed off about vmars also last week i would have said "watch vmars!!!" but thats clearly not the case anymorevmars: a long time ago we used to be friends me: yeah we're gonna be used to be friends when i think what's gonna happen happensvmars s4 live tweet thread i need to find a show with a satisfying ending so i can distract myself from vmars and i'm pretty sure tvd won't give me that I don‚Äôt blame you at all. With the disappointment from VMars you def don‚Äôt want to put yourself through tvdAnh hirap i-unstan si Kristen Bell e. üòíüò¢ At gusto ko pa rin naman ang The Good Place. Unstan nalang yung Vmars fandom. wow S4 of VMars was a real deviation, huhalso how fucking baller of to ask hulu to release vmars a week early for her birthday, what a QUEEN Agreed. Recently got my Mom to start watching it I was re-watching most of the eps w/her. She knows I watched season S4 I won't spoil it for her but she said to me the yesterday: you don't seem too gung-ho on watching VMars with me anymore. It's ruined for me now.I‚Äôll say it! I thought the movie played a little TOO into fan service! But it wonderfullh set up Veronica‚Äôs regression and downward trajectory. The movie was VMars light. The new season is VMars Classic in all its heart wrenching glory.I‚Äôm literally so mad at every ‚Äúthe ending was cheap‚Äù take on the new VMars season. Infuriating. Missing the whole point of the show. Can‚Äôt even type in full sentences!!!!! Anger! I literally could write a dissertation on why it‚Äôs done brilliantly.I was checking the of VMars and I'm angry again. And Rob's interview. Weird thinking on it, that my love for Vmars is half the reason I watched JJ, which is what got me actually interested in the mcu (and my love for DD in particular.) Maybe my take away is that we should create our own stories more, without the bs of studios and showrunners.(he's still wrong about vmars tho)made myself so anxious i cant sleep so now i‚Äôm watching vmars and being annoyed bc i hate gritty hbo-esque dramasjust finished vmars and....hmmm... seeing just how completely blind rob thomas is to who was still watching vmars and why they were watching and watching him fall so spectacularly on his ass has been a highlight of my year tbh From what I read. I got a Google alert about an "unfair ending for fans" and read it. And then looked up the VMars hashtag and it's true. And I'm legit pissed.Those same 'teen show' viewers put FIVE MILLION DOLLARS in his pocket to make a movie. They bought his VMars books. They ran social media campaigns to demonstrate fan interest so someday another network would pick up .Eu aqui louca querendo ver a quarta temporada de VMars, mas sem procurar nem nada, acabo me deparando com O SENHOR SPOILER do final e acabou na hora minha anima√ß√£o. O meu FAVORITO, o MELHOR personagem.. A vai tnc viu. O revival era para me deixar feliz e n√£o me destruir!Well, fuck THAT ending to VMars.ew what is vmars s3 opening thovmars but no spoilers: eli navarro is and always was the best character on this show Shouldn't the -100 for the foot fracture come BEFORE the +100 for VMars? And then +9000 for doing the whole SDCC weekend with a broken foot like a boss. VMars season 1 is arguably the pinnacle of the Big Bad form, it is entirely good research.i keep zoning out watching vmars bc the dudes are so dull First, I am a very sad marshmallow but...not vmars related (as other tweets have that covered) but I am looking to turn my very tiny backyard in LA into a bit of a garden. I am no greenthumb. Any suggstions/advice for a first ime urban gardener? Easy fruits for a small space?I know people are upset about the revival, but can I just say that women are more than their romantic relationship? I liked LoVe and I can‚Äôt really see the show successfully moving forward, but veronica was always so much more than that relationship. Its particularly galling on Vmars since the fans paid for a Kickstarter movie. S19 lost all its viewers without ripley. I m on board with sending krista more spice.Do any of the vmars books or web content ever mention any thing about what I assume was a hilarious tenure as sheriff for Vinnie van Lowe? I need to reread the books desperately.it's a sad day when you think "huh, the vmars writers could've learned a thing or two from the ouat writers"The VMARS movie is on the HBO channel so I guess the universe does want to torture me The VMars cast has no idea lolol and, it seems to some degree, disagree with Marshmallows on what VMars is fundamentally about. That sucks no matter how you slice it.The lip service from the PTB feels like there was another show concept brewing that used the VMars brand and fanbase to get off the ground. Stringing folks along until the last moment. Torching your property to fund your dream home with the insurance money. Very Neptune. Film school friends and I have crafted dozens of ways to get the show they apparently want to make (even if it doesn't feel like VMars) without this very bad hot take on relationships and character. With and without a happy ending for these dummies.literally can't spend 5 minutes without thinking about vmars or wanting to k word rob thomas or both Watch more vmars so you can join our clubI need vmars to actually get to the real plot I‚Äôm sad i was so excited? And?lol now ex oomf just unf'd me because i posted a vmars spoiler i have literally been talking about this for the past 3 days and it's been all over twitter for the past three days like....?j√° t√¥ ansiosa p ver vmarsIt's so weird to see people trying to tell VMars fans how to react to this season. When literally, it's BECAUSE of these hardcore fans that VMars even exists. It's best to keep the ones who actually made any of this shit possible .... happy. Not the casual fan. And they failed.TV Reviews Time! üì∫ Big Little Lies S2 finale was, fine üì∫ Euphoria gets better every ep, and Nate, the most terrifying villain of all time? üì∫ Not yet finished w/ VMars but feeling stressed about the end already üì∫ Why am I still watching Handmaid's Tale?Wow the VMars season 3 intro is horrifically badOMFG LEO!!! (Yes I saved it for after I finished VMars and I‚Äôm glad. I do love the Rose family and their community.)The actors all did a great job. Despite this, I was let down. Ultimately, I'm even more disappointed by this season than I was with the final season of GOT. Maybe it's because I loved VMars more. Maybe it's because I expected more from VMars.ok I'm seeing lots of bad stuff regarding VMars s4 and I think I'll passDo people still make music videos with TV show footage? I was binge watching last night missing today thinking that I need to watch a VMars video set to a Nick solo song. Anyone know if any exist? ? Been up late this week watching the new . Also fell asleep listening to . End result, epic dreams about being in a campaign with vmars and crew. Not mad at it. New life goal perhaps? But how many ‚Äútough, misunderstood girl has her walls broken down by the love of a bad boy with a secret heart of gold‚Äù shows should there be? VMars started like it would be DIFFERENT which was cool cuz so many other shows were doing that storyline. we watch VMars because of LoVe. Not because we love mysteries. That‚Äôs just an added bonus. You messed up. And my heart is broken. Fix it next season. I see that finding KBell annoying back in the day has spared me a lot of anger and heartbreak. What I keep hearing about the mess they made VMars is embarrassing¬£20 says VMars Twitter is mad about Veronica acting like an asshole in s4 when the entire point of Veronica Mars is that Veronica is kind of an asshole  this is just to say I really enjoyed your first stretch of VMars discussion!! I enjoyed the heck out of it, precisely because it really leans into the crime/pi genre, what you termed Hardass Veronica. Looking forward to hearing more when you get back to it! honestly i‚Äôd feel it ooc if you weren‚Äôt talking about vmars lol i always associate it with you üíñ I don‚Äôt know anyone else who watches VMars so I have to come to Twitter to get my fix. I‚Äôm only on episode 4. I‚Äôm trying to draw it out because I don‚Äôt want it to be over.I think the VMars thing is really bothering me because I've been traumatized by Marvel dumbasses and DD trying to explain away their dickness towards Natasha and Daenerys and I'm SO, SO, SO tired of men creators thinking women are devalued by power, lack of kids and/or marriage.Welp. Just saw a VMars spoiler on my timeline. I should have known better than to check Twitter until I was done. At least I know what to expect when I get to the last episode. üòÇ But the great thing about VMars is going back and rewatching once you have all the info and see where they dropped clues that you may have missed or didn't connectStarting the last episode of VMars, and I... know I‚Äôm not ready I think my brain mixed AoS and (spoilers?) VMars together üòÇ I do think it might make sense for streaming services to offer a la carte options for people who don't want long-term subscriptions. For example, I signed on to just to watch Veronica Mars, then I'll probably cancel. I'd have paid a one-time fee just to watch VMars.My boyfriend spoiled me for VMars out of genuine concern and I'm glad that he did so I could nope out of that so fucking fast. After The Magicians, I'm convinced showrunners are outta their damn minds. it's honestly going to be so cathartic to see this guy not get another season of vmars specifically because of all the dumb shit he said about veronica??? like on a spiritual level my soul will feel great about it Don‚Äôt want a VMars without the character driven story line. That story needs Logan. Save him.Loving that Hulu loves Billie Eilish. 3 different songs in the new VMars season? YaaaasSo...I sense I should just skip this new season of VMars? I am so annoyed. I just finished VMars and WTF!! V deserved to have a "happy" ending. They both did. Like üñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï I don't care for the next season... if that's even a thing. I'm out. Im done. I realised yesterday I'm still too numb about Timemess to get really truly worked up about VMars. I mean, it still hurts, but my heart was already broken by so... I asked to spoil VMars new season for me and I‚Äôm glad she did. I‚Äôm not sitting through that. What a complete disservice to the characters and show we loved. Should have just left it at the movie.every time i think about vmars i wanna throw up a nightmare lit rally Honestly, it makes me angry how they used him for damage control, like the guy looks so devastated, it breaks my heart, no damage was controlled you fucktards Rob/Kristen/Vmars Writers/Hulu Lmao I love VMars but Rob Thomas actively sucks Thank you! I watched VMars for the first time many moons again because of a review you wrote! I literally do this any time a vmars cast member is on any show. i‚Äôll be like ‚Äúhey babe looks it‚Äôs cliff‚Äù ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs weevil‚Äù I just never expected to have to have this same conversation with myself over VMars. This series has always seemed to adore its fans, so I‚Äôm genuinely surprised and disappointed. Didn't like the cancellation. Didn't like the movie. Sana ito na makakabuhay sa akin sa pagnood ng VMars. If season 5 doesn't reverse course, and go back to what made VMars great, then I'm done. I never thought I'd start to regret the show's return, but seeing how you want to treat all the characters and actors... goodbye VMars forever. i had an unrelated discussion about how love is something that‚Äôs worked for, esp when there‚Äôs distance and conflicting careers in the mix. vmars could have gotten so much mileage out of that, even beyond logan!! just. what a waste. VMars was never about the mystery or Veronica being broken. Not for me. It was about love and class and anger and vengeance and closure and loose ends and family all the stuff in between. Whatever show isn't driven by that ain't my show. So be I, I guess. doesn't owe me anything, but the same is true in reverse. VMars is in my DNA. I thought we all agreed on what the heart of it was, but I was wrong. Yeah. I think Jason‚Äôs video seals the deal for me. I‚Äôm still angry but I think Rob made up his mind about what this was going to be and it‚Äôs a shame that it won‚Äôt be the VMars that I love.VMars and MasterChef are killing me.Is it too dramatic to say that the ending of VMars s4 was more disappointing and heartbreaking than GoT? Well I‚Äôm saying it anyway. I agree. The week 2 week small cases of a 22 ep season lends itself better to the typical vmars comedy.finally gonna watch vmars s4 tonight wish me luck i hear the end sucksüëåüèº Also this all teen drama thing is just bullshit. We loved VMars because what it was. Because of the characters, relationship, humor. I understand they needed it to be more mature but they didn't have to change it all cause that means it is just not the same show anymore.I've seen so many VMars spoilers bc most people aren't using the title/names and I'm pretty sure I know what happens and kind of just want to confirm but also am mad it was spoiled and am determined to watch with fresh eyes SIGH idk what to do Aww... I‚Äôve yet to see the new season since it‚Äôs not available here in the UK and idk when it will be, but this diminishes my desperation to find it and see it a bit. :( I was a latecomer to the VMars awesomeness but I loved it and the film (can‚Äôt remember if I was able to help)the amount of S3 cameos in S4 of VMars is trolling me specifically, who has the first two seasons memorized but has never rewatched S3 and yelled ‚ÄúI DON‚ÄôT CLAIM IT AS CANON‚Äù literally yesterdayI‚Äôm alternating episodes of and episodes of and...yeah, this was a weird-ass choice, but I‚Äôm sticking with it ‚Äòcause I am quite stubborn. P.S. The new VMars theme song is teeeeeeeerrible.Soooooo... Time for the vmars thinkpieces üòèüòèI really want to write up some reviews and play CTR, and watch this movie I rented, and watch the new VMars... plus there‚Äôs laundry and doctor stuff, and I just keep reading through my tbr instead.Creo que descubr√≠ un spoiler de vmars y tengo miedo de que sea verdad lo que estoy pensando porque me toca ver el segundo cap√≠tulo y sinceramente ME NIEGO A CREER QUE ROB THOMAS Y KRISTEN CREAN QUE ESA ES/FUE UNA BUENA IDEA. I was talking about tm and vmars lmao djskks bothtodo dia eu acho q j√° vou parar de falar da quarta temporada de VMars. Mas n√£o rola. Eu leio mais e mais coisa e s√≥ percebo q n√£o tenho o menor desejo de ver. E √© mto triste perceber isso de algo q eu costumava amar tanto e por tanto tempo.Whelp. . What can I say other than I regret investing any time watching it? Not just the cold meds I‚Äôm taking talking either. Never again VMars. I think we‚Äôre broken up for good Thank you for always being there for the VMars familySe a s√©rie continuar talvez daqui a alguns anos e possa abstrair e ver essa nova fase de VMars. Mas hj ainda s√≥ estou triste e s√≥ pegando raiva com o que t√° acontecendo.to come√ßando a acreditar q morte do ultimo ep de VMars √© de verdade e mesmo q essa pessoa n√£o tenha tido um plot descente desde a primeira temp √© dif√≠cil pra mim, como f√£, imaginar a s√©rie sem ele.Just finished s4 of VMars. I blame for my inability to sleep.Am I the only one that dreams of a / crossover? mmmm love me some angst. maybe i'll dive back into it, i need something to occupy me after this whole vmars disasterI should be in bed, but I‚Äôm staying up to make sure Ana gets through the last VMars episode OkIm rebinging I‚Äôm half way through season 4 and digging everything they did to stay honest to the show and movie and still having the extra edge that a streaming service provides. If I know anything about vmars, I know the ending will fuck me up so can‚Äôt wait. üòëive always liked her but this vmars revival really... Omg. Also do I even want to know about the VMars s5 pitch?the product placement in these new vmars eps is expertly done.i‚Äôve decided that my disdain for the vmars ending can be chalked up as a disagreement btw me and rob thomas that i will EVENTUALLY be able to get overLoved VMars s4. :) Really missed the budget neo noir cinnamon tography. :(I'm definitely in the minority here, but I didn't hate the VMars revival..vmars was never a serious detective show it was a light humor teenage detective (ish) show, the fans cared should the characters not the mysteries2 episodes into vmars....where is weevil though In rewatching vmars season 1 and then the movie, I happily got a Sammy fix recently but I agree!Just finished the new season of VMars and I am crying so fucking much. It was perfect but also I am so hurt. This cut deep.I always say tvd and ouat went downhill, but vmars is rounding out the trio.Arrived back home to the states and immediately started binging . Vmars has still got it, marshmallows. I absolutely agree. I loved it and it felt like vintage VMars. I won't be watching any new seasons and will consider season 4, sans those last five minutes or so, the end. Ps VMars was only Season 1,2 and the movie. Those are happy times i like to remember the show by 3/8 ep of vmars we finishing tomorrowCan I just say how VMars is doing press about *spoiler's spoiler* has given me reassurance that Stranger Things did not *spoiler spoiler.*I am sorry I have not gotten to all the replies, followers, etc on my vmars friend tweet. I got a lot more than I expected and also am dealing with a hurt hand/wrist right now.I love VMars, but this new season is stressing me tf out.i grew up with vmars, it was one of those shows that my dad, my sister and i used to watch when i was young every saturday. it taught me how to be a strong and badass woman and not to be afraid to be different. while i was not a fan of logan at all and probably never will be + I have loved Vmars since the first episode, back when you had to wait a week to see what happens next...I loved the new season, I'm sad at the ending...but I understand why did it that way...veronica was too worried about how her choices would effect Logan Yes they were in the same ep of VMars, bc they were just off AD at the time You said you don‚Äôt need to explain but I will. VMars and her father are the heart of the show. VMars and Logan were the soul. Neptune, the skin I couldn‚Äôt swear it‚Äôs impossible for me to love a new version but my confidence isn‚Äôt very high.anyway goodnight, vmars still ain't shit. I think your idea for a kick ass female detective show starring the amazing is an amazing idea, BUT it shouldn't be called . Vmars IS Neptune, and Keith, Wallace, Weevil, and yes Logan. Anything else is simply not Veronica Mars Yeah I saw someone saying she was sorry to VMars fans, and I got scared and finished as quick as possible. How is that even a question? VMars is EPIC!How I Met Your Mother: we had the most insanely unsatisfying ending to a series/season of all time. Man our fans are pissed! VMars: Hold my Beer.i hope the backlash from the ending is so massive that they never get the future seasons they did it for. i, for one, is never watching another episode of vmars.VMARS did not deserve Jasonlots of problems with vmars season 3 but the way this college works is number one for me, sorryeu tava absurdamente no hype de vmars da√≠ saiu e esqueci mas coloquei pra baixar agora.. bem na boa.. e a√≠ de repente passou uma cena aqui na minha timeline e eU QUERO ESSA SERIE AGORAAAAAA I still love VMars... but super hurt at that ending.has anyone else but me and finished new vmars yet I'm done with season 4. It may not be the VMars we wanted, but it's what we needed at this point in the story.I just got hugely spoiled for VMars. Fark.time for vmars season four let‚Äôs go But I think each actor I tagged originally (I stopped because I could have/should have tagged the entire cast) would all be so interesting to have a conversation about VMars and life withI hope that Rob Thomas' excuses and the inexplicable press coverage about what happened on VMars keeps Rob warm at night. No amount of press is going to make an audience of any substantial size show up for a S5.What I'm hearing about VMars is embarrassing, writers keep getting lazier and dumber lolSpent the weekend being upset about only to read explanation and get pissed off all over again. No desire to finish off the eps. Ive followed VMars weekly since it first aired on UPN. Hated Logan initially but transfixed by his complexity. This is wrong.(I much prefer the first, and I tend to think VMars would have been a more satisfying story as one great season, but then again I'm not employed by telling that story. For those who are, the second explains a lot!)I apologize to all my mutuals that aren't VMars fans for me blowing up your timelines with my angry rants. I promise I'll calm down soon LOLi refuse to ever watch one single second of vmars without logan echolls in it I figured that but was thrown off by Handmaid‚Äôs and VMars being on there right away. Thanks! Great way of putting it. Rob‚Äôs plan is to make future VMars with just Veronica, yet most of us aren‚Äôt even rooting for her anymore after how she acted all season long And vmars has never been good at focusing on any other story arc for characters other than Veronica. The characters that ever received attention were Logan and sometimes Keith.where does that leave your audience? And s4 clearly showed she has nothing in common w Wallace anymore yeah well that (about Sherlock) sounds the same about VMars, but also what the producers are teasing about what next I think is a big part of it. A difference between not liking what's happening now but it could turn around and not liking where they are intending to take itAnyway, I'm gonna be a full time vmars s4 hate acc for a while.What‚Äôs the most heartbreaking about this whole vmars thing is I feel like Thomas is saying that the three years of the show and the movie were shit and now vmars is *high brow* and worthy of fanfare. Love you Jason! Thank you for bringing Logan Echolls into my life. As for vmars, I‚Äôm done. The way Rob treated the characters this season is unforgivable. Omggg same i loved coming home from school and watch VMars and see LoVe fall in love there were truly one of my favorite couples! And now mehh.. they ruined it all and they cant even give us a decent explenation Talking about VMars?! Cause i'm right there with youwth. i havent watched yet the new season of vmars then i saw a spoiler that logan is dead?!?!?!?!?!I don‚Äôt pretend to know the grand design of Rob Thomas‚Äô plans for VMars but I do know that the revival both gave me what I wanted and didn‚Äôt. I understand that this was essentially a whole new story and I will never have hatred in my heart for VMars and Co... 2/? That explenation just makes me more mad tbh.. it's just shitty writing to me they were happy they had their happy ending and then they give us such a crappy ending in the last 10min like?! I have always loved VMars but not just cause of Veronica.. exactly she‚Äôs a grown woman who should be taking the next steps in her life, she should be recovering from her trauma, she should be in a healthy relationship, but apparently only an alone and lonely vmars is good in the eyes of rob thomas and kristenomg i am desperately trying to dodge all VMARS spoilers today and it is DIFFICULTI‚Äôm on ep5 of Hulu!VM now and: can we crowd fund to NOT get VMars revived ever again? ThanksYES i have read all the vmars spoilers NO i do not want to talk about it Perfectly put. So many people question ‚Äúhow could VMars be an escape? It was always so dark‚Äù THIS IS WHAT WE MEAN. She pushed through the darkness WITH the people she loved in her life. Veronica without her family/friends/love is just not interesting. I haven't watched yet! Let me finish the new Vmars season and I will get right on it.This may be the lesson of VMars and all reboots fans asked for. You know what, leave Pitch alone. Let's keep that one season locked in our precious memories as perfect. Bc the alternative...overwhelming temptation to read the replies on that vmars tweet. still have 2 episodes to go but I've already been spoiled bc the internet ruins everything, but purposefully clicking through is a step too far for me.......Damn. All the spoilers on my TL for Vmars. üòí I'll be back in a week w my reaction...ik i dont even go here but it‚Äôs qWhite interesting how only i‚Äôve seen mostly male fans be satisfied w the s4 vmars ending ü§î really makes you think wow tagging rob thomas into my vmars complaint thread. a bold move I don‚Äôt know the answer to that. I just subscribed to Hulu on Saturday so I could watch Vmars...if cbs all access shows are included...maybe I‚Äôll keep it.haha, i'm on ep 4 of the new vmars. and at least if hulu is gonna advertise hulu... while ppl are watching on hulu. they're advertising harlots. A WONDERFUL SHOW THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE WATCHING BC CHARLOTTE WELLS IS THE BEST. i just read vmars spoilers... very interesting.the more i read the less i wanna watch s4 of vmars and i was so excited for it to come back üôÉmy review of new vmars: strike this season from the official recordwow such a shame that vmars got cancelled after season two but it‚Äôs SO cool for all the actors to keep showing up through the years to film alternate versions of what would have happened üôÉ love an AU since this CERTAINLY would not be where the original show would have gone üôÉüôÉLRT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS AIN'T SHIT. VMARS A lot of the anger for me is not that he did it, it‚Äôs how he did it. It was so flippant... and we didn‚Äôt have time to grieve. It jumped to a year later in a blink of an eye. But I can go on and on about the mistakes they made in s4 of vmars. It feels like a betrayalI haven‚Äôt been able to watch the new VMars yet and I haven‚Äôt been spoiled but I can pretty much guess what happens at this point. VMars s4 did Weevil dirty. That's the one thing I'm pissed about. Weevil deserved better. He is my favourite character and I have rage. He has seen the movie. The day it hit HBO I watched it. I was desperate for new VMars content. u were the show of Veronica Mars and what happen ruined everything that was so good about this show fans r truly heartbroken i cant stop thinking about it i wnt watch another episode of vmars again u deserved so much better pls find a way to come back fix thisi just got spoiled for the entirety of vmars season 4 and i!!!! am so!!!!! mad!!!!!!!!!!!You know you date your best friend, , when you both spends hours contemplating what that shady ending truly meant... However, thank you for an amazing seasons and bringing all the feels.  This seems like a solid choice, IMO. I'm low-key working on convincing to watch VMars with me.I'm so distracted thinking about VMars, how am I going to get through This Day.in the cold light of morning I do have some critiques of the new vmars but most of them‚Äînot all but most‚Äîboil down to ‚Äú8 episodes isn‚Äôt enough‚ÄùVMars is my icon, my goddess, my goals! Badass girl detective?‚úîÔ∏è Enemies to lovers?‚úîÔ∏è Smol? ‚úîÔ∏è Good Dad?‚úîÔ∏è Just THE BESTMost nonspoilery thing re:VMars S4. I'm impressed at the season's ability to work in all the relevant stuff from the books without making it feel like you've missed something if you haven't read them.anyway, good afternoon vmars ain't shiti‚Äôm sad that mac hasn‚Äôt made an appearance in new vmars (unless...?) but i‚Äôm liking the mystery!! man I haven't watched og vmars in SO LONG but I remember him giving good gazevmars spoilers// im haunted by the scene where veronica rues that the 'old, exciting' logan is gone and logan punches through a cupboard and sadly says 'is this what you like?' and she jumps him and they have sex :((((((((( :(((( don't TOUCH MESo, when have we universally decided that it‚Äôs okay to start openly speaking of VMars spoilers - after the 26th (for those who stuck to their original watch plans)? Let's just remember that Angel and Vaughn from Buffy and Alias respectively came back after being written off and those two shows are basically VMars sistersI really liked 2019: A Mars Odyssey (A Neptune Odyssey??) - definitely better than the movie, Vmars needs to be episodic. And the ending was true to form - it's always been a neo-noir series first. Not like the utter betrayal of Jessica Jones season 3.ser√° que o rob vai foder com o final de izombie igual fodeu o final da temporada de vmars.... humI really love that Hulu is bringing vmars back but I‚Äôm gonna be sad again when it goes :((A good place vmars crossover with the censored swears. üòÇ you're the 2nd vmars reylo fan i know who is also disappointed by it ksdjf;sdf i seriously can't believe it either :/noah fence but re: That Scene on vmars, there‚Äôs literally no reason for that, it‚Äôs pointless and was just done for shock value and yeah i‚Äôm madVMARS. As much as I love Leo, you better goddamn break up with Logan before you make out with Leo. Not that that wouldn't be some poetic symmetry, but Logan has been through enough.I know exactly one (1) spoiler for vmars s4 and it's kind of enough to make me want to watch?I don‚Äôt like this new cover of the Vmars theme song.ok i'm nearly done with vmars s4 and kinda sad there isn't a lot of wallace or ??? no mac ???FINALLY TIME FOR VMARS!!!I just realised a retweeted a VMars spoiler. Sorry!!Season 4 of . I'm not sure how I feel. It was perfectly persnickety as one would hope but THAT death is so "cussing awful". I understand it's parr for her story and I still love whole heartily but it's a little different now.  oh yes VMars might take the cake for maximum creepiness. I didn't know he was in Boy Meets World!!!Did Spindrift singlehanded fund the VMars reboot? It‚Äôs episode 2 and we‚Äôre already on the 3rd very exaggerated product placement.Fuck you too vmars writers Could I have done with maybe one more sweet scene of romance before it all went to shit? Sure. But that's just me floating on my ship. As a matter of good story, domestic bliss Veronica Mars -- or VMars in a rocky marriage -- sounds like a snoozerThings going unappreciated for VMars Season 4 - JK Simmons character. (a complex character that I hope comes back) - The dangerous yet comedic crime duo. (I loved this) - There was so less Weevil (my fav character) - but he shone at every moment he was in. - The tone was on point I watched all of VMars this weekend, I got no problem admitting I'll watch more of anything that I once thought was good.I really want to restart vmars because I miss Logan but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to put myself through thatok I haven't watched new vmars but I remember in the movie he was definitely a navy lawyer, right???? like I didn't just pull the JAG concept from nowhere but in the tv series he's a pilot???? both are inexplicablei don‚Äôt want to see ANY vmars spoilers bc i haven‚Äôt watched it yetOmg new vmars!! I CAN HAS!!! Wish they could've taken over for the reboot of VMars. We would've gotten a much better ending then the shit show we received üò≠üò≠üò≠tentando baixar torrent de vmars por um site que nunca usei e sofrendo bastante para obter sucessoSo who else finished vmars season 4 and wants to d*e..... I‚Äôm starting a support groupi would love to have some vmars fans to talk to and be friends with who still love everything about the show. feel like maybe i have too much faith in vmars but i also feel like all of your faith in tv writers was polluted by watching the cw for so long but i kinda sorta don't think he's dead.... yes she didüò§ the gilmore girls revival only loses to vmars s4 because it was also so bad YEAH I mean we all know it, the Dandy Warhols were only good for 1 thing that was the vmars op song!question for my VMars people: do I watch the movie before moving onto season 4? or does it not matter?UHOH. VMars, are You the toxic member of this relationship? I think you are. This is not good for Logan.Quer saber que se foda essa temporada revival de vmars que se FODA F O D AQue final cu. Ainda bem que VMars acabou no filme que cada f√£ pagou pra ter migo, j√° assistiu vmars? I'm so happy to read this, because I feel the same, but it seems that the fandom thinks Rob Thomas ruined the show and is a lazy writer. I thought it was wonderful. Heartbreaking, yes, but the VMars I missed that the movie didn't fulfill.anyway goodnight fr, to god's gift to me - Doom Patrol s2 but vmars still ain't shit.anyway goodnight vmars ain't shitthe single funniest thing on vmars season 4 was when logan replied to maloof's mom i'm still losing it at that sceneok but how cussing dare you Otimo faltar o ultimo ep de vmars e eu sei que vou quebrar meu pc movida pela forca do √≥diowait if there was a vmars panel and a good place panel do we get 2 fancy solo KB photoshoots? and I know melissa was there for Jay and silent Bob too. lordy.i finished vmars this am and i have thoughts(tm) but the biggest one is: WHERE IS CORNYonce a girl sets and hardens, her life becomes a series of apologies.... goddammit vmars stop thisOkay my deck umbrella is NOT standing up to this rain. Time to take my White Claw and my VMars fanfic inside. As SOON as I heard people got spoiled for the ending and were upset, I suspected. When I saw the title I knew. that‚Äôs one of my favorite fictional characters and I wanted more for them. I will never be able to watch further VMars if they made it. Not without that character. I was laughing so hard!! This is the VMars I missed.Oh Veronica.. :(((((  Vmars for Lost?GOD the only good thing to come from the good place was kirby howell-baptiste ending up in this season of vmarsi meant to put this in my vmars thread but JESSICA CHASTAIN?????? MA‚ÄôAMM??? there were rumors all week of it happening and then when critics started writing about it in vague terms...i skipped to the last 10 minutes without watching any of the season first. i'll get to it eventually because i have loved vmars for so long. Heartbroken. Devastated for Ve. Veronica is now poised to become a serial killer. How rough do her edges need to be? These characters, their words, humor, love, sense of truth justice are the show. The mysteries are just the vessel to express these things. üò™  Plenty of teen romance shows out there... Good ones too. Why does VMars have to be one? I had no idea he worked on vmars...I'll rant more about the Vmars thing in August when everyone should have seen the new season but I will rant bec√†use I have a lot to say about choices.Justified reference in the finale of Vmars s4. Sending up a flarei‚Äôm so morbidly curious about vmars like i‚Äôm not invested enough yet to actually understand or rlly care about whatever happened but the need to Know what awful thing happened has me more motivated to watch than anything else has djdkdhsYou know if i was phil id be so heartbroken about vmars like that was his firstborn, his baby, and now even though he has a new baby they literally murdered his firstborn childi finished vmars and i need everyone to never look at me again So of course I fell asleep to my heartbroken VMars thoughts last night, but then literally the second I woke up "KIDNAPPED" came to my mind. It actually makes perf sense would be genius to make her think that go mad from it...As long as that‚Äôs the end and I never try to watch another episode at all??? That‚Äôll be....alright. I think. I don‚Äôt watch VMars for fluff. That‚Äôs what fanfic is for. LOL genuinely want to know if the vmars cast thought fans would react positively to the new season.... y‚Äôall think we wanted a beloved show to come back only to kill off one it‚Äôs most loved characters.....  I think John Green says it best ‚ÄúBook belong to their readers.‚Äù I think the same can be said of shows and movies. It‚Äôs not up to the author how I feel or what I think. VMars outgrew being just his over 15 years.Finished the last season of Vmars. On to the movie.ok the idea that real estate companies would have "insane security" made me snort like do y'all know how much fraud happens there üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Omg that is big bullshit! More like lazy writing to me... there are other things they could have done to make a statement/impact they didn't have to do this i love Veronica but she isnt the only character i like in this show VMars is about more then just her imo Just finished VMars season 4 and cannot believe that that spoiler got spoiled for you in press materials! That is just bonkers.im really going to have to buy hulu to let vmars stomp on my heart huhJason Dohring is out here snatched in the VMars show and I love it.Also, unrelatedly: I haven‚Äôt been spoiled, but the reactions I‚Äôve seen make me think I should just skip watching Season 3 of VMars. Yes/no?lemme get rinna's vmars recap pleas ei'm halfway through vmars and the way everyone has been talking about it i'm so fucking scared!!!!!!!!!! Yeah, the spoilers were bad. I‚Äôm sure the movie is fine but I feel like I‚Äôm OK leaving VMars in 2006.Am I a whole fucking mess after VMars?? YEAH NO SHIT HONEY. WHY WAS THAT NECESSARY?!?! This is not at all against Hulu, but Vmars lovers have good taste and this season is going to piss you off. Add PrimeVideo to the budget in December so you can watch The Expanse if you haven‚Äôt already - it was made for us.the further i get into s4 of vmars the worse and worse the characterization gets, and i may just be being petty bc i know the ending but,,, this is just. badNonspoilery new VMars threadwatching vmars bc where's my self love?oh heyyyy liberal redneck! wasn't expecting that appearance. If you think I'm not singing along with the opening cover for every episode you're wrong FYI interested parties I have watched episode one of the new VMars text me when you have etcSo I may or may not have slipped into a foul mood? Time to sleep. Hit up for all your VMars lovin‚Äô, my DMs with your ideas of you wanna plot and my curiouscat if you got questions you need answers to. honestly just use the movie as the ending for vmars it at least treats the characters with respectVMars copying the True Detective opening and listing brands off thirty seconds into the episode isn‚Äôt a particularly great sign, but I will soldier on.VMARS HOPPING ON THIS DND TRAIN WE DO HAVE TO STAN!!!! dm: you come to a door. perception check! player 1: i‚Äôm drunk. player 2: i‚Äôm very drunk! SOMETIMES IT DO BE LIKE THAT!!!!!vmars season four, please hurry up and give me her name im in love with her PLEASE I don‚Äôt think so. She is in so many things, much more profitable and she always tries to squeeze time for Vmars. I really believe she is a genuine and kind person VMars is fantastic you will not be disappointedi don‚Äôt think i realized this when i saw vmars the first time but DAMN veronica is real fucked up. i‚Äôm in love with her now, we all knew this was going to happenI need to stop being bitter over VMars bc everyone else is being so good to me. But it was an essential part of my adolescence.editing naley to take my mind off vmarsAlso I love how they refer to vmars as ‚Äúmy detective show‚ÄùTime for !!!!Mira, de verdad, ver contenido nuevo de VMars again es un puto caramelito vmars on there is a moodcool. finally spoiled myself on vmars and safe to say it no longer exists. goodbye. I have not seen VMars, but am aware of it. Looked up the ending, and wow, that is one giant slap in the face to fans. I'M pissed off and I'm not even invested. This is to you what Avengers Endgame is to me. I have to actively Not Think About It or I get very angry. üíîJust spoiled myself for something I didn't want to know (the identity of the bomber in S4 VMars) while reading spoilers for something I did want to know about the end of the season. D'oh. In retrospect, I should probably have anticipated this. üôÉOk, I've breakfasted, showered, filled my water bottles, watched episode 7 of VMars am ready to head to the park. Let's get this reunion started!! the most frustrating part of vmars s4 was not the ending, it was veronica's complete bullshit with logan going to therapy and her immaturity and unwillingness to see that people grow past the age of 18vmars does endings for shock value. they always have. always cliff hangers, always fake outs. they want another season and they want ppl talking. if you didn't watch when it aired, you didn't live through this, you had your answers immediately in your tv binge.Still a fan! But she's not on my very short list anymore of favorite white women after giving the OKAY to ending VMars this wayI‚Äôve watched 4 episodes of VMars and I‚Äôm so scared to watch more. I have seen some vague things and my nerves about the end are super high.Okay yeah I'm two episodes into vmars and like I'm only worried because the internet made me worried but uhhh I see all my hopes and dreams are crashing downme during vmars s3: when will piz be treated with the love and respect he deserves me during the vmars movie: WHEN WILL MY BOY PIZNARSKI'S DAY FINALLY COME me during vmars s4: LOGAN??? ECHOLLS????????this episode of vmars made ME SADi‚Äôm sorry this is late but warning not very well hidden vmars s4 spoilersVMars 4.8: Who are these people who need the Previouslies? Who would finish episode seven and think, sure, I'm going to sleep fine tonight.I‚Äôve been trying to watch this one episode of vmars longer than the actual episode üëÅüëÑüëÅI spy being a concern citizen of Neptune!!!  hulu for vmars!I could stay up til 4 and finish the VMars season... (I didn‚Äôt even watch vmars until 2013ish but it‚Äôs eerie how accurately the soundtrack reflects my high school experience)I'm still so annoyed that I typoed. I refuse to correct it, much like the VMars writers did with the finale script.unless rob thomas hands me logan‚Äôs life on a silver platter i‚Äôm not supporting vmars season five send tweetn√£o aguento mais ver s√©rie aleat√≥ria e n√£o aguento mais enrolar pra n√£o assistir vmarsThe more I hear about the Vmars revival, the more it sounds like they‚Äôve somehow managed to surpass the idiocy that was season 3 and it‚Äôs making me less inclined to watch.So I'm still loving VMars s4, but I can't help but notice a lot of the introductions of fan favorite returning characters are oddly flat. Like, they don't build a moment or reveal, just "oh hey, this guy you love happened to wander into frame".So I finished VMars s4 and uhhhhhhhhhh my DMs are open for anybody else who has, I guess?Tonight I‚Äôm just in my feelings talking to about the finale even though neither of us have watched it. Why VMars, Why?!?!?!?best part of my life rn is reading the comments absolutely ripping into rob thomas on all the vmars finale recaps we all hate ya bud!!! go fuck yourselfGot to VMars 115 in our binge today, give or take skipping eps 1-4 because, sigh, my S1 DVDs are missing the first disc. (Pro tip: never lend things to anyone ever.) Tomorrow's goal: rest of S1, the 2014 movie, and then as far into S4 as we can manage...I haven‚Äôt watched the new VMars yet but I read spoilers for the finale and I AM BEREFT üò≠üò≠üò≠ Dude, I still haven't watched the new season of VMars. Do not spoil.THAT ENDING OF THE NEW SEASON OF VMARS WTFFFFFFFGoddamn Rob Thomas and his sex dream sequences I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET STEFAN AND CAROLINE‚ÄôD AGAIN IN MY LIFE!!! How do I go back in time where I didn‚Äôt watch the new season of VMars?!enrolando pra n√£o acabar vmars ü§†Dang. There are many, many people echoing my sentiments about the writing choices in I am being very careful to identify this as a bone to pick with the writing, as I will ALWAYS be grateful for more VMars. But yeahhhh...lots of good points being made on Twitter...Why did she not say YES!!! The proposal gone bad... and sad.Watching and OhMyGawd it‚Äôs been a ‚Äúlong time ago, we used to be friends‚Äù ... thank you I just really want VMars self-defense merch. Ignore the possible PR nightmare and make it happen My friend calmed me down. Lol I'm a sucker and would watch another season of Vmars. I just need time to get over this mess lol also thanks to everyone who didn't block me already for being a nutcase xDThe beginning of the VMars credits music sounds exactly like 500 Milesbinging VMars is good for your healthSide Note 2: RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD AND MORE SHOWS SHOULD REFLECT THAT REALITY TY VMARS.my dumb ass been tweeting VMars and Stranger Things and David Harbour content for weeks with like two whole FFH tweets and Marvel really said BITCH YOU THOUGHTSeeing all the hatred towards the ending of vmars is making me so happyhave jel muted bc of vmars and I never get a notification when ever she sends a dm ddjskkdjdjsjsI went for the free month trial of Hulu to watch VMars and just realized there are like three other shows I need to marathon in the next 30 daysDigging the new VMars on Hulu. (Even though 's streaming kind of sucks.) My boyfriend had to spoil me. At dinner the other night he was like ‚ÄúI have to tell you something, but I don‚Äôt want to tell you this.‚Äù At first I thought he was breaking up with me. Nah, just saw a VMars reddit thread and knew I‚Äôd be devasted.amanda seyfried being in vmars and then showing up in the ads for the the art of racing in the rain in b/w we love thati didn't add vmars to my tumblr savior fast enough and got spoiled for things........ rip me. time to watch faster i guess. and hiding behind "it's noir" is bullshit. just because she is married with logan doesn't mean she is destined for ultimate happiness. More seedy, dark, and destructive VMars could still be told with Logan still in her life.I've slept and I'm still not cool with Vmars. Also it's almost impossible for people to keep quiet, and in this case I think it's unfair to ask that too.Nominating myself for a medal for my incredible restraint in not livetweeting the new VMars, which I LOVE SO MUCH except for the usual issues I've had with the whole series.Oh! VMars is out in Canada now. And i am not done my rewatch, because I am what? Awful.Remembering how done dirty I felt when the last season of Buffy was out last year but dang compared to vmars I was treated well at least my mans lived üëèüôå stellar job, amazing season. Bring on Season 5. Vmars ‚ù§Ô∏è forevernao recomendo escutar this love nem sad beautiful tragic pensando em vmars e logan....about the vmars revival ending ... i will simply say, i get why it had to be done. it made complete narrative ( even creative) sense if they hv their eyes on future seasons. but i ABSOLUTELY LOATHED how they did it. they way they did it was such an insult manipulative as fuck. I still haven‚Äôt even watched past the first 18 min of the first episode but my whole tl is either the supergirl cast which is happy or vmars which is heartbreaking and angering and im just here like ü•¥now that lauren has finished vmars i can say, from the bottom of my heart, fuck you i don't go here for vmars but if those spoilers are legit... ouch. i'm sorry for you guys.today is gonna be ... interesting. havent gone in to work with this many clients on 4 hours of sleep in a very long time. also ystd i pretty much only consumed msg and refined carbs while binge watching the vmars revival. so ... yeah ...ok but ig i dodged a bullet right there by not watching vmars huhfinished vmars. am now sad the way I don‚Äôt even watch the show and I‚Äôm still mad bc all my vmars oomfs are upset like wtf kind of shitty writinghalf of me is so happy at supergirl cast comic con content and then I'm like.... fucking depressed at vmars. Just something abt vmars that pissed me offwhen you‚Äôre still on s1 of vmars and see a massive spoiler for the revival. we ok üò¨‚ÄúNew‚Äù Vmars theme got me right in the feels.day two of not being able to watch vmars, and again, if you spoil me i will ruin your life. veronica taught me how, i‚Äôll be thorough.i'm sorry if i spoiled vmars for any of you btw Yeah it‚Äôs not for me. But we‚Äôve got VMars back. S‚Äôall good. vmars ending of the original show or of s4? bc they got cancelled back in the day and that‚Äôs why the ending was open ended and stupid REALLY GOT KEITH MORRISON ON VMARS IM I‚Äôm not feeling the new VMars intro song but I‚Äôll accept anything to have my favs back againI've been talking to y'all paying people back for things buying tickets to book events donating to charity for like a FULL HOUR and basically NOT hiding from the internet and still haven't been spoiled for VMars. I don't think this is going to hold much longer so BYYYYEFinished Stranger Things. Loved it! Finished VMars. Loved it. Onto Fleabag. Then a rebinge of Wynonna Earp. If only life didn‚Äôt get in the way of my viewing pleasure. idk anything about vmars but I‚Äôm gonna start watching it now bc u have inspired mesaiu uma semana mais cedo a s4 de vmars e n√£o to nada preparada pra assistirWHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK VMARS SPOILER DID I JUST SEE watching vmars. you?i am creating a kickstarter to put the vmars writers down, the benefits of putting them down is that i would get hurt way less thank you, i‚Äôm so glad you enjoyed it! not done w/ the new season yet, but i doubt i have another vmars fic in me üò≠ every now then i write a story that‚Äòs what i personally needed out of a piece of media? then i‚Äôm Done Forever, bc i put everything i wanted to do in one spot SCREW SOCIAL LIFE. WATCH VMARS. ü§£I realize that we are literally the exact same age but seeing clips of on VMars all I can think is THAT IS MY SON üò≠im currently downloading 8 eps of vmars, 8 eps of queer eye and 10 eps of jessica jones and for some reason my laptop does not like itI now realize that no one will see this tweet because you all have VMars blocked.40 minutes left of vmars and my heart is stuck in my throat and all my muscles are clenched.

Something about the cinematography kept it mildly disorienting in a way that grabbed and rewarded attention. The Cliff scene was magnificent I fully adore VMars, but to be honest, everything after the 1st season doesn‚Äôt fully live up to that perfect, tightly plotted season.officially at the hyperventilating point of a vmars finale !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Worst season ever. Real nice way to treat fans who quite literally funded the VMars movie. I was a diehard fan and I will not be watching the next season. I think I‚Äôll cancel my Hulu subscription too he waits for no one when it comes to vmars lmaoThe new Veronica Mars title sequence is pretttyyyyy. Also: this is a VMars fan account for until the TFC match tonight.Have just been reminded by 's thoughts about how hard I shipped Veronica and Weevil, because they were the best kind of bad idea for each other. Finish VMarsjust saw a vmars spoiler i-vmars ended in 401 after veronica said ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs home‚Äù in reference to logan and then proceeded to go find him on the beach so they could bang,, can‚Äôt believe s4 was only 15 minutes long*Two* city council meetings on VMars so far! I am taking this as a personal gift. VmarsI‚Äôve had a really rough month and binging vmars has been a real saving grace and for them to do that just truly broke my heart. I‚Äôm never going to get over this just now saw the title of the final vmars episode !!!!! okay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Spot. On. VMars was always careful about tired gender tropes. That all went out the window with this endingI've such am annoying headache and I blame it on the lack of sleep and vmarsThose last 10 minutes of episode 8 of vmars. No thanks. Take them back. I refuse.I actually want to watch vmars without finding out anything big for once djdjdnI‚Äôm two episodes into s4 of VMars, which I watched before bed last night. I want to watch more but I want to make it last all weekend so I‚Äôm gonna take a break for a bit today. Fourth, if you signed up to Hulu/Crave wherever just to watch the show, cancel and notify the service it's because of the dangerous message of the VMars finale. They log reasons. If they're flooded with comments on this show, it will matter. Det g√∂r FYSISKT ont i mig att jag inte kan titta √§n!!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠ Det √§r min och mammas grej att se vmars och hon √§r bara p√• s√§song 2 √§n i sin rewatch... m√•r fruktansv√§rt men det vore den v√§rsta sortens svek att kolla utan henne I have no errands, did them all after leaving work yesterday, so I‚Äôm hiding, I‚Äôm gonna watch VMars and MAYBE make Eton mess...although turning the oven on even for meringue seems weirdGimme before the internet spoils it for me üò≠yes i'm still fucking burned and betrayed by gilmore girls, glad i never got invested in vmars honestlyWhat's really fun about them is they aren't pretentious about TV so I can get them to give any TV show a shot. I got them to watch 90% of True Blood (we only stopped bc their favorite character died) so I'm decently confident they'll dig VMars and I am SO excited about thatI JUST GOT SPOILED FOR VMARS............this cannot be true wtf..........i‚Äôm so mad I‚Äôm in the latter group. I was going to sign up for Hulu just to watch the new VMars season and rewatch the old ones, but then I heard about the ending. I‚Äôm keeping my money and I‚Äôm never going to watch anything else Rob Thomas is involved in.i wanna watch vmars bc veronica but i just dont think i can do it alone djfjfkfi refuse to watch vmars if i don‚Äôt see it then it didn‚Äôt happen never felt so betrayed by a show. ending basically shows how little the creators understand their fanbase. Yes we love strong sassy VMars, but we also love that she has found her match in Logan. That they complement each other. It‚Äôs possible to be strong and in love ya know.vmars spoilers //// i care more abt logan proposing to veronica than my own life tbh BITCH I‚ÄôVE WAITED 13 YEARS FOR THIS sooooooooo i guess vmars ended with the movie huhJason Dohring looks *amazing* on the new vmars, but he finally looks his age and it‚Äôs so jarring. He had the baby face forever and now that he actually looks in his mid to late 30s. He‚Äôs handsome AF and I love it, it‚Äôs just surprising.Did all my fave shows make a deal to suck big time this year? Got, qots, good girls and now vmars...im lit rally tiredI see vmars season 4 is a big dissapointment. Great. All that excitement i had is all gone now.üòûVmars why you hitting me in the feels with Keith in the first 8 minsvmars bringing back recurring characters from season 3 as if I remember anything from that train wreck of a seasonOH GOOD I have a new crush on VMars. Like I needed more impure thoughts when watching The Logan Veronica show, here comes a REAL sexy new character binged VMars and damn you got me right in the feels. Loved your energy but felt scared as you drove off you wouldn‚Äôt be back. You‚Äôre coming back right? Right? There will be more? ahhh i cant be objective when it comes to vmars. all i can say is if you love the series and the movie, you are 99% likely to love the revival too.I'm just gonna ignore Vmars s4 like I ignored that 70s show s8 and qots s4 and remain unbothered Acordei e j√° tem torrent em 1080p de VMars, pena que n√£o verei agora.(sort of but not really a vmars spoiler) I really wish wallace was in this season more :(Finished the Vmars movie but I can feel a headache coming on so we might leave the new eps until tomorrow.What upsets me the most about the shit show that is the VMars reboot is how 95% of the promotion was based around LoVe. They baited the fck out of fans only to shit on us. This reboot literally wouldn't exist without the fans. I will never get over this disservice. Okay VMars, let's do this.It was me, i watched all the vmars in one sittingwe stayed up to finish vmars and boy I have some thoughts and feelings so mutuals feel free to dm my ass about it!!!!!!!! if you haven't heard yet Logan Miller's in VMars this year as a supernerdI‚Äôm so scared for vmars tho everyone‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs bad but I can‚Äôt watch for a few days because I wasn‚Äôt ready for it to drop yet :((not me spoiling the vmars revival for myselfif logan and veronica are not together in the new season of vmars i don't care about it and won't watch it, that is one hetero ship that means 2 much 2 me to do without it.On this Saturday we are truly blessed for I have no plans and VMars season four dropped a week early. Marshmallows unite.trying so hard not to spoil the vmars revival for my fellow marshmellows. BUT OMGi can't believe the only man i will ever trust to write a show that won't be a complete waste of my time was terry matalas for 12 monkeys in light of the vmars spoilersI know taste is subjective and never universal and all that, but I am genuinely confused that VMars made it past a first season and people apparently still watch and care. Guess when Kristen bell and rob thomas said they will make VMars for as long as possible, they forgot that they needed to get to a finale that people would actually want to keep watching. Jenny look at you cornering the podcast game for not just one but two of my all time favourite shows! I just rewatched VMars so I am primed and READY I needed VMars so bad. My life is at the worst it‚Äôs ever been. And you just took my reason to live. Theres just no point anymore. Apparently nothing can ever be happy or good.SPOILERS FOR VMARS ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è ok so im hoping that * isn‚Äôt dead cause we never saw their dead body or them actually going to into the car. hoping there is some sort of kidnapping plot pls im trying to think of anything credible cause i will not accept this ending.I‚Äôm going to repress the last 10 minutes of vmars s4. This is how I‚Äôm deciding to get through this. VMars has dropped even earlier than the early drop. In case you are interested...Was pretty sure what the spoiler was for vmars but I just looked to be sure and uh wow y‚Äôall were done SO dirty I‚Äôll ride with you at dawn I think on balance I'm going BBad VMars JJones for Ritter's noir damesok im exhausted on account of I've been up for 18.5hrs so I'm gonna have to watch the last 3 VMars tomorrowwatching the vmars revival and i have to say ... im nervous. i dont have a good feeling for loganica.it's safe to say that I won't be watching s4 of VMars after knowing what happens lmaomy real life is rly interfering with trying to binge the new vmars and queer eye episodesFinally starting vmarsüò≠üò≠üò≠i‚Äôm doing two (2) shots of rum and watching buffy the vampire slayer episode 3x8 ‚Äúlovers walk‚Äù to numb my vmars painthe true crime enthusiast in the vmars writing room suuuuuuper pulled their weight for this season. comedic AND dramatic references are üíØüíØüíØAll vmars fans, I just wanna give every single one of you a hugso hard not to stay up binging VMars, it's television catnipI literally had no idea that so many folks on my TL were so passionate about VMars üòÇI'm preparing for 6pm by watching the VMars movie.

S12 are very good and s3 is mostly crap.My husband a month ago: "I know you love it but I don't want to watch " Hubs 2 weeks ago: "ok 1 episode."

I‚Äôm not okay.Thanks hulu, for knowing I felt like garbage and needed VMars season 4 to drop earlier than I expected  Between VMars, Lilly, Mrs. Casablancas, and Paris Hilton...Logan your type is showingVAGUE SPOILER i am fucking sobbing weavel saving veronica and keith. their discord has been so hard to watch. someone sedate me. i love this show What do I want for my bday?

WELL I WOULD DIE FOR HER IN VMARS TOOnah but really the vmars spoilers feel mean, yanno? like i pushed this show out of my heart a long time ago but lots of people haven't and it's shitty to do something like this to them especially considering that people have literally financially supported this show and yeahi can‚Äôt believe the vmars movie made me give a shit about pizWell then. I'm just gonna... go back to VMars and pretend that isn't a thing that's happening.rofl the james franco cameo in the vmars movieI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a spoiler to say Logan gets into a fist fight on the new VMars and it‚Äôs super hot. Thank you for adding to my list of things to mute, I didn‚Äôt have VMars (was planning to go to a friend‚Äôs place to watch but I‚Äôm sick and don‚Äôt have sufficient internet to stream it at home) i ordered crave just for vmars and now I'm only seeing the first 3 seasons????The GOOD news about VMars Spoiler is that if I know that fandom‚Äîand I do‚Äîthere‚Äôs gonna be fix it fic inside of like....four days.Oooooh, VMars is going haaaaard after the 3rd season not well handled rape plot.

Should I unfollow you for now!? ‚ò∫Ô∏èI also forgot how much I like the vmars movielogan stans complaining about vmars s4 are making me want to watchso we all agree that vmars ended with the 2014 film right Ira Glass was in this? I swear all this VMars talk sounds like gaslighting tons of stuff I never remember So far as I‚Äôve watched no...but VMars is incredible so you should watch it anyways I would've been current on my VMars rewatch but I watched all of Schitt's Creek instead, I am comfortable with that choice. Bring on s4!going to sleep because i cant stay awake for another second im literally so so tired but i hope that when i wake up there's a link for vmars I love veronica, but so far logan almost deserves better than VMars. But still all the way lolBlarghhh. I don‚Äôt wanna sound ungrateful we got S4 of VMars early, but like...I guess my premiere party next week is fucked.

I‚Äôm just plain not as invested in s3???? Encourage me to finish or tell me what I should watch next? River dale?ALSO IS MAC IN THE NEW VMARS Kristen Bell says you have to watch vmars to be a good friend u should listenwhy do i feel like rob is gonna give me everything i want with vmars, and then rip it away again?? When you‚Äôre re watching vmars and your next episode is weapons of mass destruction (when Logan and Veronica first üíã) AHHHLiving in EST like "its 12:30 where is my sdcc updates????" And meanwhile its like 9:30am there most folks are too hungover to start yet but I need my VMars panel updates!!!!!!! It's so weird that VMars has an actual marketing budget now. I spent so much time creating marketing shit for this show for free back in the day in save VM campaigns lol. There's a booth on the back wall selling different types of memorabilia!! I don't remember their name, but VMars is hanging on the left panel when you walk up!!the vmars music that plays when veronica is on investigative mode has me boppingstaring at the line updates at 5 am (WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE) and wondering if i hate/love myself enough to get out of bed and lyft to sdcc to guarantee myself a spot for the vmars label now that you‚Äôve been watching VMars again do you remember how WONDERFUL weevil is???????????Shocked Schmidt Cop wasn't revealed to be the VMars serial killer. What a missed opportunity!!I don‚Äôt work tomorrow so I will be finishing vmars Roo "the only person in the whole world who watched vmars" Grump is their going to be a way your fans from Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø can watch VMars ‚ù§Ô∏è your MarshmallowsA small secret part of me wants to see what Weevil and Veronica would be like as a couple. This thread has turned into my VMars Secret Confessions. Chicago and Second Chances and Prosthetic Love can never be in another movie/tv show because VMars owns those songs. Period. The vmars movie was really made for the fans, now that I've rewatched 2seasons and a half i basically caught all the references and old characters and I was ü§° just feeling itTime for the VMars movie (got sidelined yesterday). I like to believe my hard earned student loan money I gave to the Kickstarter purchased one of Veronica's shirts or something.I think I'm gonna skip to vmars movie and then go back to s03 bc I wanna see happy veronica and loganExactly why I was dreading vmars coming back: the fuckin ship wars. The official shit alone is being pretttty gross about it and everyone knows the shitty pairing will be endgame so WHY RILE PEOPLE UP AGAIN JESUS CHRISTvmars s4 drops in 8 days and i am: scaredomg hello this plot twist in vmars I was not expecting that !Really need to honor the vmars revival with a tattooi‚Äôm rewatching the vmars movie and i... just... realized... that veronica says she transferred from hearst and never touched a case again bc of the relationships it cost her... aka .... logan.... ok ok it‚Äôs finehonestly never felt more dupped than when vmars showed us v/l being a cute summer couple and then revealing her bf as duncan in the present timeline... GARBAGEso much of my tl is vmars now and 2004 kelly is wilding outwish it wasn't taking me forever to finish vmarswait did rob thomas from matchbox twenty write vmars or are there two rob thomases i‚Äôm going 2 have a stroke I mean it's later than VMars but he's playing a baby conservativeThe flashbacks scenes on VMARS are very much ‚Äúwhat if TWIN PEAKS was on the WB‚Äùthe men on vmars are so bad (i started the show ü§™)I realize I‚Äôm probably in the minority here, but I am very firmly Team Pizz when it comes to VMars‚Äô love interests. Logan and Duncan are both the WORST. Pizz is the only decent man among them, w/the possible exception of Deputy Leo (I was never clear on the age diff there). it would be the best birthday present ever if you had a VMars themed run of interviews like or üòÜ pretty pretty please?!I just got the sudden urge to finisha 5-year-old VMars WIP lets stop trying to guess worst ending ways of vmars s4 oomfs im going to be sickBritt Daniel of Spoon singing Elvis Costello, def did not recognize him the first time I watched this show (making this my official VMars rewatch thread)After some reconsideration, I‚Äôm cool with Piz. I love Logan, but he was a mess and he and Veronica had life they needed to live before they could be together. Idk how ppl have already watched the new vmars season, I guess critics did,,, but I DON'T WANNA KNOW ANYTHING ok hello so how excited are you for vmars' return?Both Ivonne Coll and Michael Hyatt are in the jury duty episode of VMars, love early bird CW cameossomebody add me to a vmars gc or make on with me so we can cry and stress out togethermy vmars oomfs who have waited years for this deserve it okay if they don‚Äôt get it i stgAnd then VMars s4 and thrm Harlots s3 and then season 3 of my horse drama BUT LIKE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO DO THE TIME TRAVELING BALLERINANow that we have finished watching all 2 seasons and a movie of VMars, tonight we are going to start a show called Find Me In Paris which, uh...seems to be about a Russian ballerina from 1908 whose boyfriend accidentally time travels her to 2018I'm gonna have to have an actual coping strategy to watch the new Veronica Mars, and part of it is gonna involve having 2 other shows [OITNB and Another Life, thanks Netflix!] premiering the same day that I can switch to in case I need to put VMars in the freezer.after the vmars episodes come out i wont leave my room till im done with all of themi just watched an ad for vmars that popped up and logan is still in the navy???????? still in the navy. he hasn't been drummed out for insubordination or anything yet? sure. I‚Äôm secretly kinda glad i didn‚Äôt get IT because I‚Äôm a bit of a scared baby about that stuff haha. I‚Äôm still hoping to find some kind soul who wants me as their date for the Veronica Mars taping on Friday. I‚Äôve never been more a fan of any guest he‚Äôs ever had at SDCC than VMars.i don't want to freak out about vmars yet but..... we nervouswe goin ‚úàÔ∏è vmars season 3andy is officially done with vmars i feel like a proud mama Cats and VMars, yes!this is really all just to say that i know many of you were jerking it on TWOP when vmars originally aired but i personally was just watching it on the tiny tv in my bedroom that had an attached vcr and writing about it in my JOURNAL and look not to be a luddite but that was lit vmars vibes tbhI did NOT remember that Armie Hammer guest starred in VMars and I am weirdly delighted by his appearance.  VMars/Sons Of Anarchy crossoverI hope KBell gets Emmy nominated for VMars next yearAre you following the Vmars IG account with the sleuthing game?  I like this attitude. How early are you lining up for VMars üòÇ that‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm not going to get into, everything else looks perfect and it‚Äôs gonna be amazing.Krysten Ritter is also fantastic in VMars Great stuff as usual. 10 days till the new season of VMars!tessa thompson on the vmars opening credits üòåüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºvmars stans when do duncan and veronica break up and when do leronica get back together im strugglingi'm not really in fandoms anymore and very few shows get me excited but vmars is like my all time favorite show. i watched it while it was airing and it was a very formative part of my childhood.i know it's not for another week but i don't think i'm emotionally ready for vmars season 4 Honestly as a VMars fan this is exactly the style of review I wantedrewatching vmars and veronica and logan‚Äôs first kiss happened and i got butterflies! butterflies!!!!!!!! I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about, VMars ended one episode before the first season finale and was never revived. Just one-ish season of perfection.[Cw: rape] I need reviewers calling VMars a return to form to clarify WHICH form, because some of us still remember the feminist group raping a frat boy in s3.i‚Äôm watching vmars and drinking a vodka cranberry..... i miss ella really hoping vmars will break the streakI‚Äôve got no basis for this except for the fact that 2019 has been really shitty to me n my fav characters but: I‚Äôm scared something is gonna happen to Logan in s4 of vmars ü•∫vmars comes back soon but i can't watch it for a couple weeks cause i'm gonna be on vacation with no wifi :(It‚Äôs hard to maintain my long lasting fondness for when I watch watching vmars at 17: veronica mars has never done anything wrong, in her whole life, ever rewatching vmars at 31: look at this petty ass childPiz's hair hurts me.  (But I mean, even without that previous tweet, you'd probably cry anywayyyyyyy. Because it's VMars.) Us Marshmallows would love to see some Funko pop of the VMARS cast!! Let‚Äôs make this happen!! Wait, new VMars started? I'm still only in s1 of my rewatch üò£Seeing a lot of VMars promo pics but not a lot of in those pics. I need me some Weevil I started watching VMars in 2013. I was 16. Clearly in this talk of the new season of VMars being darker and more adult, the writers forgot that there's a plot where the dude who killed her bff literally tries to fridge her. Don't search for answers when they're aren't any. Reason of why the VMars movie was crowdfunded so quickly.it's the vmars christmas episode and logan's mom just referred to his dad as an extremely handsome man??? heterosexuality is NUTS that man looks like a shoerewarching vmars for the 20th time in prep for new season and fuck the pilot is damn good is vmars good? ive been meaning to start it but keep putting it off whoops (I love talking about vmars!!)I‚Äôve made it to the leo point in my vmars rewatch... BABY BOY BABY
