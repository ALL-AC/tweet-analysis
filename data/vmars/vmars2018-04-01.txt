 Groan!....... You'll be joining VMARS next. Anymore? I thought this was pretty standard after things like the VMars movie. I love that franchise, but it's pretty much the same.The wife and I are working our way through and keep finding random (but not really ) remarks and it makes us miss the series sooo much its so sad seeing that people dont edit old tv shows as much as new ones like most of the new ones suck? vmars and dexter are so underedited Speaking of VMars, I finally finished ‘Mr. Kiss and Tell.’ It might’ve been one of my favorite entries for the series. And I know your busy making awesome shows like iZombie. But whenever your get around to more material for us Marshmallows, I’ll be waiting ever so patiently♥️I NEED VERONICA MARS MERCH ! I MISS THIS SHOW SO MUCH 😭 if any artists sells vmars fanart and stuff on redbubble, please tell me 💖 rewatching Vmars and you know what I always dwell on? If Mac ever connected with the Sinclair family. It just always seemed like there were places to go with that. It's possible I missed something... I think every female character was subjected to some form of sexual assault on VMars I LIKED VMARS. But it was yikes w/ that. Thanks vmars😇 Goodlookin bro💯 I co-sign this tweet as someone who first recognized Alba as “that juror from VMars!” Also I’ve def co-signed this before, but I hereby co-sign again. Me and Vince been waitin til the weather breaks to go Sup wit it Literally we there soonI don't wanna pay .99 for VMars season 2 but I also can't go another day without watching it oopsim really gonna binge watch vmars for two wholeass days maybe i snAPPED 😶 come see me at the diner Starting with BSG, dropping Buffy and GoT. Honestly if they had mentioned Lost or VMars I would have orgasmed I had a long reply few hours ago and then the internet ate it. So I am bummed and off the internet for a while. Anyway, generally what everyone said it's true. Watch Buffy The Vampire Slayer Angel the series first (on hulu), especially if you are a VMars fan So much. Buffy had some all time great moments but a lot lot lot of ho hum episodes and some that really fell flat. To me, VMars was more consistently very good. I'd put Angel ahead of Buffy for the same reason.LOVED this week's - VMars guest stars, Bridget Jones chat and tunage!  Pretty sure I yelled loudly. I still jump every time. It still hurts.
