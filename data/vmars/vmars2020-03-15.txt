VMars season 4 is now in progress. I can't believe I'm finally almost up to date with all y'all nerds. btvs! ats! vmars! gilmore girls! uMmmM SUCCESSION!! in the past week I've watched the VMars movie for the first time, and season 4. Absolutely gutted by the penultimate scene. Thank you for such an story. I'm gonna go cry more now 😂😭  Um before you do that, could I have a VMars script if you have one? I’ll pay postage and for your trouble. 😁😁😁 Who wants to waste their time watching a mystery show where the detective doesn’t solve anything?also vmars and jennifer aniston and private practice and many other things Vmars forevayesterday i watched vmars movie and today im gonna watch some random LoVe episodes. We love pain.caught up to the VMars movie and while on second viewing I have a LOT of thoughts (especially about that misplaced addiction theme), let’s first just pour one out for the show’s unsung lesser hero, Deputy Sacks that’s the ~actual~ last installment in the vmars universeWatching the vmars movie. im sad.I finished all my vmars sp i wanted to make and damn the amount of rewatches and crying i did for those 4 scene packs. I was never mad at LOST. I liked the ending. Heroes was only 1.5 seasons of my life. This latest ending on VMars comes close.20yrs ago, the gov't built a gladiator league to fund the DoJ. 10yrs ago, Zita's mom became a gladiator all-star. This year, Zita built an app the DoJ wants— and has uncovered a nefarious league secret that they'd kill to protect. WILLIAM GIBSON X VMARS  I didn't know this podcast existed and I'm definitely going to check it out because if there's one thing I love more than VMars, it's trivia. You DO remember how often the show resembled a bad soap opera right? I mean it was 80% awesome, and at least 20% wtf. The movie ain’t perfect but it’s completely VMars. Soooo exciting! It's like characters from 2 of my all time favorite shows (YAH and VMars) merging with Sofia Rodriguez teaming up with Dick Casablancas .. I'm so here for this! lolADI's video - the video was by Alec Gillis, again, I can find HIM but not the video - shared the take that the VMars kickstarter did something _weird_. Specifically, that kickstarter STREAKED to a few million, then its rate of growth slowed EVEN AS ITS backers skyrocketed. Just occurred to me that VMARS S03 might’ve been among the first shows/seasons to basically have a mid-season finale. Which seems to have become A Thing. I don’t remember the details, I think this was probably a compromise. It was a little weird even then to discourage long arcs; LOST was huge at the time it debuted the same night VMARS did. I get that VMars’ first two seasons didn’t get the audience they wanted. But I’m shocked that if the network meddled, it wasn’t “make the show less serialized and more episodic” — the usual conventional wisdom back then but “serialize it in smaller chunks." I like that you name them early and I have no idea what they are named until I literally publish. I have a WIP called vmars_breakupfic lolVMars update: I have reacted the movie!THE VMARS SEASON ONE FINALE!!?!!?!?!!
