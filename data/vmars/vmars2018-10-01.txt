😂😂😂😂 on Friday this man vmars used a trash bag as a blanketWeevil saying "you are unbelievable" to VMars is like him saying I love you 3 Alternate universe... the idea that iZombie is basically VMars if VMars was set around/during the zombie apocalypse. Not a wholly new premise or character set, just renamed and placed in a slightly alternate setting/universe. i feel like if you enjoyed vmars you would enjoy this though like it's genuinely a lot of funLa batalla entre que me duela la cabeza y terminarme los dos dvds que me quedan de Vmars xD Well hopefully yea I think he is, Foles is tho for sure 😂😂😂 I mean he helped get the 1 seed but still lol gotta give Donovan respect for getting there, just didn’t get it done, wasn’t built, not many are tho Ahaha tom just told you to sit down and put your seatbelt on We didn’t even have him in the playoffs till the super bowlLa primera vez que vi VMars me tocaba mucho los huevos Logan durante la segunda temporada, pero realmente actúa como alguien con el corazón roto y 3 ya queda poco para que vuelvan a estar juntos, aunque sea por poco tiempo againSólo Vmars es capaz de decirle a Logan que no haga algo y que le haga caso xD2 more episodes and im ending s2 of VmarsHay dos partes de VMars que me tocan los cojones: cuando vuelve con el picha floja de Duncan y Piz. Loved VMars!! I may or may not own the series on DVD. You've made me cry so many times over the 15 years of being in the Wicked Pumpkin Girl fandom. Your words are all heart, and I'm so glad I found you through VMars. Thank you for sharing all of it, your books, your poetry, and your thoughts. Omg yes! It's like all my fave TV shows colliding, VMars, OTH and iZOMBiE❤Every time I rewatch VMars I *think* maybe this time I will get completely on board with the LoVe train. Maybe. Oh I’m kinda on board... I’m here... NOPE, NO. Abort. Abort. Lol yea definitely wasn’t ready this year... trade for Earl Thomas??😂 I’ve always wanted it to be Douglas, big with length and he’s good at playing deep balls Sadly no, I’m in London designing , I’ll miss my VMars family! The basketball fan in me is kinda excited. He’s actually been a long time fan of VMars and Rob. He gave a glowing review of Rob’s old YA novels years ago too. He wrote two Mycroft Holmes novels so maybe he has some skill?a great day to remember that logan and veronica are returning to me in 2019. vmars and hulu are my best friendssssi just randomly remembered that there's actually going to be a whole season of vmars on hulu, and dude... DUDE THERE IS NO VMARS WITHOUT LOGAN I saw Logan and thought this was VMars. Now I’m just confused.Dear dutiful Twitter follower , I am a qualified Post Production Supervisor and totally available to join you and Kareem on this latest VMARS journey. Just sayin. What about music? If it helps, I bought a van from the singer of the band who played the very first song on the very first episode of VMars.Mac better be in the vmars revivali wonder if the VMars revival will at least unleash a torrent of thinkpieces about incredibly fucked the show's sexual politics were bc wooftina majorino and ryan hansen have to go back to vmars right? i mean they have to bring mac back dsjfdkjvdfjkn and i know we all hate dick but also i really enjoy his presence ffjhbsjf Since you so heartlessly killed his character off of iZombie, I think you should add to VMars 🙏🏼 Kareem is, quite literally, the biggest VMars fans. maybe i should actually do that vmars rewatch i’ve been considering on and off for like a year! I hope you’re right my friend Yea but whose back there when the safety gets beat.. no one, and that mans has been gettin beat a lot thus far Just really don’t like him back there at all Why have one when you can have more Mills I’m saying, like someone gross Him and a draft pic for a developed cornerI still have never seen VMars in my life but I see the news that Francis Capra will be back and all I can think of is rewinding over a decade and being like “wow, would be all over this.”i wonder if the VMars revival will bring back tob rhomas' fave sex offender dick casablancasI guess it was too much to hope the VMars revival would have more women and not have Logan. VMARS + this. our fave shows are immortalJASON DOHRING BACK FOR VMARS YASSSSSSI think the VMars revival makes me so happy because so many of them (especially Kristen) seem to be doing it out of love, not money. Or, not just for money. They want the show back almost as much as we do.Al final os estoy ignorando y estoy con Vmars porque es la más corta de las 3 xDDan and I are watching Veronica Mars season 3 right now. Dan: GOOD GUYS ALWAYS FINISH LAST!! ... poor guy... Me, watching VMars for the millionth time: I know... I know..Because of and , I was able to take these characters and figure out how to tell my own stories. I was able to get over the initial fear of writing, because it gets easier each time, but that first hump is huge. Thank you, Rob.  Oui mais dans vmars il y a tessa ! 😁 well, I guess I know what I’m doing while I’m on call tomorrow.... rereading the 2 VMars books! 💕🦄omg wait i never watched kristen’s vmars announcement video THEYRE ADDING ALL THE OLD SEASONS TO HULU???? THAT’S BETTER NEWS THAN THE REVIVAL 😀😀😀😀 i’m currently making my husband watch the show! gotta make sure he is a vmars fan!! Fortunately , you’ll never have to know the awfulness of the “Aerie Girls” who came on just before VMars and talked about the latest on Gilmore Girls. 😒  You could aspire to be a writer on VMars. This dream is now an option again! Yeah I've been reading the rumours for a while, but didn't dare to believe them. Then I heard them out of mouth and dude. I cannot. Sometimes I stare at my VMars poster and cry because I'm so excited. I knew there was something about you I liked! I had no idea you were also a VMars fan! Hi Hulu! How can Australian marshmallows watch the new series of ?! Yeah s3 wasn’t great but it was the show least deserving to get axed that year. Like the upn was by no means a quality network but they were starting to turn around and vmars was a big factor in changing their perception and reputation. Girlfriends too. Wished they never merged. Heh. Not gonna type it out cause I refuse to give it complete mention. But it’s the show with numbers. 😜 and no cw is not involved whatsoever with vmars revival. Warner Bros. though owns the rights to it and is producing it with hulu. This is literally it. I'm getting Hulu. Handmaid's Tale came damn close to breaking me, but VMARS?! I'm sold! Hardcore Noir 🤩 Tessa only chemistry I liked was MBJ and Wallace from VMars. 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️im so glad vmars is coming back and i dont have to pay for it this time So excited for new VMars!!!! Who needs to catch up? My show of the summer was VMars Definitely excited for VMars 🎉🎉 But def do NOT want Logan Veronica ruined in anyway!!! I'm sure everyone of them has to know that! It would be super disappointing without  I haven't watched it in, IDK, 10 years? When was VMars on? But I do remember feeling disappointed at the time. Not sure I could've articulated why, either. of course you're a fellow vmars fan!! I don’t often get excited enough about anything to comment on social media, but this news has me all a twitter 😁 can’t wait for more ! já pode mover VMars de volta pras ativas, obg I mean... V Mars certainly slays. So if Slayerfest98 wants to cover Vmars.....WELL TIMED FOR THE VMARS REVIVAL NEWS TODAYduring the vmars movie stuff rob and kristen were so annoying about how "piz treats veronica better and logically she SHOULD choose him over the ~bad boy~" like i guess logan's character development doesn't exist?? and also since when was veronica perfect?? that's why they WORKEDY'ALL. VMARS IS BACK? LOVE THAT The news I NEEDED right now. We used to have VMars watch parties in HS and as I approach the 10 year reunion this what I do to do instead 🤣 I love VMars so much!Today is a GOOD DAY. - If you didn't tag, DM, or text me the VMars stuff today: are we even friends? can you dl vmars on hulu for us when it is outFor those new to VMARS, it's Nancy Drew meets Film Noir and you'll see future greats in their young days including Kristen Bell, Chris Lowell, Krysten Ritter, Amanda Seyfried, Max Greenfield, and Tessa Thompson tho the vmars movie was heinous even tho it involved a literal podcasting subplot sort of. so they better no screw this up¿Qué pasa? Vuelve VMars, Daredevil cada vez más cerca, Captain Marvel.. es que no puedo con tanto.VMars is coming back!!!Ok, Marshmallows. This is what I want in the revival (not a reboot). I want LoVe. I want Keith/V snark. I want Troy. I want Max. I want Madison redemption. I want Wallace to find love. I want Mac to find happiness. I want Duncan to get closure. I want Kendall to be alive. AY DIOS, es que vuelven Buffy, Embrujadas y VMars, y espero que VMars considere los dos libros canon y que Logan vuelva y vuelvan todos y ME MATO I was just thinking about how I wanted to rewatch Vmars the other day but couldn't find it! I'm so excited! I do have the movie somewhere! anyone thinking about catching up on VMars now that it's being brought back, it's a strong possibility that hulu will put up the first 3 seasons since the previous streamer dropped the rights! (Though it may not happen until closer to the series' premiere.) First Buffy, now VMars. Xena next? There were rumors of it a couple of years ago, but they dropped it because the world wasn't ready.VMARS IS COMING BACK LADIES AND BITCHES It's also been interesting to think of VMars with the extra context of iZombie and how certain things have played out there too in terms of relationships, esp "platonic" ones. Bugs me sometimes, but it's worth it overall. Wait holy shit tell me more about your Veronica Mars book (I say from the depths of a VMars reboot where I can't stop thinking of all the things I want to write about this blessed show)In the new vmars seasons will we find out if she decided not to waste her entire schooling by at least taking her exam to become a lawyer and will she set her romantic sights higher than her teen relationshipsPues este finde me voy a Algeciras y me voy a trae los DVD de VMars, Alias y Buffy aka the anual feminist bad-ass rewatch just announced another season of VMars. I 👏 CAN'T 👏 BREATHE 👏  AMO!!! conheci a linda da kristen bell primeiro por vmars ugh same i need vmars to be streaming somewhere soon so i can rewatch  omg vmars...i was literally watching it before tsn i can't breathe
