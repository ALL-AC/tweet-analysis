 Good looks brooh, it's him. vmars is usually better at twists and unexpected suspects than this!  gfhdy yeah i’m watching vmars rn actually. still in love with lilly kane. It took me ~ 23 years to find the sort of people who care enough to listen to me fangirl about something they have zero interest in, but still be excited/interested enough to ask questions. (My boyfriend hates cop type shows but he watched season 1 of VMars with me b/c I love it)lol get it, his last name is fagin and he's mentoring young criminals and making them help him steal stuff. real clever, vmars.  Jessica Jones would probably benefit from a structural analysis of VMars, actually. 1. Did you see the movie? If not watch it. 2. Where did you watch VMars bc it’s not on any streaming service and I could use a rewatch! OMG faayza remember when Aaron played fuckboy Troy in VMars mmmmm my love for V Mars may have just found a RollerCon outlet. VMars v Jessica Jones. 😱 everyone has to wear witty one liners and solve crimes (duh). Of course, I had to tell you despite your retirement. ❤️ I think it lost itself after season 2 but I still watched to the end haha, but yeah I def like vmars more cause I too enjoy the mystery part to it.. I’m planning on rewatching it because of you Thanks buddy OH i thought it was vmars lmao oops. i’m sorry tho THAT SUCKS omg heres a funny 1 for u...i live in quebec were my fiancé is also frnch and i have Luv VMars my whole life :) but it has only ever been findable in english so all my french friends dnt understand my obssession..yesterday we found it playin in french! i get to spread vmars fevr Does it have to be a movie? Because watching an episode of Veronica Mars at the Alamo in Austin with a bunch of other VMars fans is honestly still one of my favorite moments, 10+ years later.iZombie helps fill the VMars void, but I cringe every time Liv is introduced as Ms. -not Dr.- Moore. BUT!! S3E9, while responding to a gunshot victim, an older man bustles up claiming "Miss, I'm a doctor!" and Liv snarls "So am I! Get out of my way" 👏👏👏 I AGREE 120% everyday I hope that it will be today that I hear they are rebooting vmars and she now works with mac and her dad with her lawyer degree and spy skills .... ahhh how the reboot could be better than the original and that is rare but they have the power lets see if....Another weird thing on this VMars rewatch: I'm suddenly noticing all the Trump jokes. MANA DO CÉU, eu não lembrava que a Tessa tinha veio VMars!!!! I just always need to make it known that I love VMars because it is so underappreciated and that is upsetting okay S2 of VMars is great but there were very good reasons to sleep on Thompson.I was watching and Mr. Mars and Eli came out of nowhere. And I was like, what, did I watch the wrong show? I know I was just overreacted but whatever, it's VMars, how could you not be overreacted????
