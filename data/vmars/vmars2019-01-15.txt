 y’all lost Love u guys. Enjoy the couch25 more episodes of vmars leftSo what I'm understanding is that Bennett, in addition to being Casey Gant on VMars and in numerous TV Christmas movies, was in also a movie with Dina Lohan's daughter, was in a music video with Frankie Grande's sister, and was on the same season DWTS as Lolo Jones. I was wondering the same.. I watched all I could on Hulu and was going to cancel until VMars came on but now I’m rewatching Roswell - such a great show !!! as clear she'd be a future star as when Chastain was on VMars Thank you for these updates 3 its so awesome to hear/see how happy everyone is to be working again on VMars :) I’m still bummed I missed out on being in the Vmars fandom in its prime 😔 I found it 2years after the movie was made. So I’m glad it’s back and I get to be a part of the active fandom now 🙌🏻🙌🏻but is Tina coming back to vmars? Stupid people!! For sure! VMars Rocks! Yeah ight watch that 😂😂 Yeah ard I shoulda left it😂 Preciate you bro🤞🏾 I'm listening to the newest AE while cleaning but all I want to know is when Ryan Hansen and other VMars friends will be on.  i voted for vmars but i equally vote for fdtd and also buffy. has the dumbest UI ever: I purchased a show. I’m in the middle of binging it (shout out to the epically awesome ) and every time I start, VMars is nowhere to be found on my list. Like trust me, I am I to this show. But no, I gotta go search for it. 🤯 She's so beautiful as always ❤️   I GOT MAN OF STEEL AND VMARS HOW COULDNT I BENow I really gotta do a VMars cosplay. *whispers* New VMars is coming to Hulu You already watched my favorite show ever (VMars!) but this is definitely 😊 😃 Here’s hoping 2019 brings us good new VMars content!
