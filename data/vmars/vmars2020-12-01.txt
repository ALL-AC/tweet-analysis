ok im finishing the oc and then ill finish vmars 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩 I recently saw someone who'd just finished the 4th season of VMars and they were furious. I've steered clear b/c of all the negative reviews of it and I loved that show during seasons 1 and 2 (I can't remember season 3 but I think it was fine?). Yes!!! Loved it! Especially all the VMars referencesgod I forgot I need to continue vmarsIssa vmars night y'all. ❤️can oomfs please watch vmars so i can have someone to cry over love with and also someone who’s talented and can edit them😭 that’s the girl that died in vmars and the murderer from you finish vmars because you’ll get attached to the characters in dawson’s creek and won’t be able to finish vmarsshould i start dawson’s creek now or wait to finish vmarsbut oth gilmore girls dawsons the oc buffy vmars and bmw ate up the others i think tentado a pegar o de vmars pois ali que deveria ter acabadoThe veronica mars s3 finale doesn’t even feel like vmars and it doesn’t really provide any conclusion i feel like they could’ve done it so much better yeah its similar w logan x veronica from vmars bc their og ship name is LoVe but its hard to tag so searching leronica is easierThe guy Rory had that awful “date” with at the end of s4 was Duncan from VMars. I also feel like being in WB fandom back when it was good and proper ~THE WB~ has left me in a weird place to all of this, where some of the reactions I'm just like "Wow, this feels ahistorical but I haven't been around since like VMars ended so maybe you're right!" eleanor vmars rachel that gif is very sexy wait and heartbreak doesn’t scare me, i mean i started vmars knowing how s4 ends 😭 vmarsrly just told benji that vmars is glee but instead of doing glee shes a detective watch vmars it’s like glee mixed but instead of glee club it’s shes a detective same!! but you're gonna love vmars 💓 yess couldn't get past the oc s1 so i decided to drop it and watch vmars instead!!though my favourites off the top of my head are buffy, angel, vmars, the oc communitysame with a lot of shows tho like vmars has the exact same energy lmao 😭the world really went into crisis the moment the vmars revival dropped. if only we could turn back time to stop it from being greenlit Random but I just wanna say fantastic screen name. Vmars helped me survive high school... nooo GET attached i love vmars and i havent even seen s4 (the one after the time skip) and i still feel like its a complete story. TRUST ME keep watching until the end of s2. s3 is pretty bad tho which vmars couple? also when did u stop watching? There was this one episode of vmars that was just ... so dated I wanted to die I am not gonna pretend I understand how the TV production world works at all so my only experience is with pushing for an experiencing VMars in 2014 and what they went though, and with that I say it’s possible, and from where I’m standing we have more on our side than they didthinking about how Dianna was on vmars and they were both in burlesque like do they Know each other ... does Kristen remember dianna on vmars... dianna was in burlesque for like twenty seconds I just need to know VMars was on the WB/CW 2005-2007ish they started at the same time 😭😭😭😭 i need to finish vmars and all american but i guess i will finish all american faster so probably in two weeksalr the time has come for me to wash the last episode of vmars yall wish me luck im not readywhat time should i watch the vmars finale?? AAAA YES I WILL DO MY BEST TO FINISH VMARS IN A WEEK OR MAYBE TWO TO START MY NEW ERA CANT WAIT vmars is so good but u should skip s4i will watch all american when i finish vmars i cant still postponing thisomfg it’s been a year since i started s4 of vmars 🥺season 1 finale of vmars is the best episode of the show in terms of plot and crime-fighting,,,, i said what i saidalr todays the day im gonna finish vmars wish me luckgot stans 🤝 vmars stans 🤝 spn stans watching a traumatized character with amazing development die for shock value im so mad i havent been this mad since got and vmarsthis is what I did with VMars lmaoLIKE THEY WERE SO WRONG FOR THAT IM SGILL SO UPSET AND I FINISHED VMARS A YEAR AGO DONT INTERACThis name is cassidy...if he’s anything like the one from vmars cannot be trustedi feel very emotionally connected to all of kristen bell’s characters. idk if she gets typecasted into similar characters and ive never watched vmars but i feel spiritually ~mhm~Anytime I see an actor from VMars or gossip girl on white collar I scream you don’t belong here and that’s rude (anytime being the two times I have so far)Forgetting Sarah Marshall will always be one of my favorite movies.... I’ve always simped super hard for Kristen Bell 🤤 Ever since the original VMars days!watching jag made me randomly think about logan echolls becoming a fighter jet pilot and then how i never actually watched vmars s4 after i learnt that spoiler I've never seen any vmars no, my vmars s4 anger. it’s always there. waiting. vmars referenced archie comics too Who on the writing staff originally from Beaverton wrote their coming to LA and getting robbed experience, into a season 3 revenge fantasy and Meet Cute for Vmars and Piz? vmars era starting sooner 🤞vmars s4 being spoiled for me is so much 😭😭
