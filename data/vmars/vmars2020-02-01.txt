 I'm generally on your side in this issue but please, can we avoid sexist diminutive terms like calling a woman you don't know 'sweetie'? Thanks RIGHT?!?! valid! i had a huge vmars phase when i first watched it and then reading what she actually says really put me offfffff. like after the good place I definitely do not wanna be watching her work anymore 😭 Don’t gotta tell me twiceMost of Zita's cohorts are genetically engineered, but she's the only one designed after a murderer. That made her unemployable— until she invented an app the tech elite couldn't ignore. She'll do anything to prove herself. Anything... except THAT. VMARS X THE CIRCLE 20yrs ago, the gov't built a gladiator league to fund the DoJ. 10yrs ago, Zita's mom killed a major tech CEO and became one of its stars. This year, Zita built an app the league wants— and uncovered a conspiracy that threatens them all. New Age Gladiator x VMARS  100% I'm as mad as I ever was. I'm only not posting about it as much because they don't care, and so it's only hurting me. Yes. This exactly. I think she does. That's why she keeps her around."She's not my old lady. She's my special lady friend!" Thank you, VMars, for that deep cut Big Lebowski quote.Anyway, serious VMars question: why is Duncan?In this single episode of VMars is: Charisma Carpenter Steve Gutenberg Krysten Ritter**P.S. I Still Love You sorry sorry I'm too excited for accuracy Will this be like the VMars movie when I heard the soundtrack in advance and just knew???? (I haven't read the book, because I don't read many books, I'm working on it)I only found the show a second time because of the OG, Veronica Mars. My old ass made a Tumblr to get VMars movie spoilers and my dash was flooded with Olicity gifs. Felicity was not even a thing in the 1.5 episodes I watched. I can’t believe you didn’t also tag me in this, Tory. It’s like we’re not even VMars sisterwives anymore. I'm listening to this VMars soundtrack playlist and Momentary Thing just came on and I just screamed and reached to grab your arm instinctively Wait, i uploaded it on Drive for my fellow VMars friends, I'm sure I have the link somewhere I'm forever traumatized by the end of VMars to the point that I edited out the last 10 minutes and for me the show ends with the wedding. And since the show has been officially canceled (thank god) nothing will convince me otherwise. No, the other one. Zachary Ty Brian. JTT was probably the more notable of the two characters in VMars, being in Weapons of Class Destruction, but Zachary Ty Brian played an 09er bonehead in several episodes (and the same character, but demon-summoning evil, in this Buffy ep)I’m in the middle of a VMars rewatch (I HAVEN’T SEEN THE 2019 SEASON NO SPOILERS), hence the reason Caz was my frame of reference here 😂 good morning i love vmars. Oh my god she should just STOP already 🤮nothing but respect to the owner of vmars s2 finale,,,, cassidy 💅 Yeah becsuse its the same creator of vmars. Ryan (dick), enrico (keith), percy (wallace) and chris (piz) are also in few episodes in izombie. And in one episode there is kristen's voice Right? I didn’t even know about VMars until last year haha Yeah it’s interesting to compare contrast because I’d say Riverdale draws some inspo from Vmars. But Riverdale went high camp w/ it and Vmars remains somewhat in the realm of realismreally liking the vmars movie so farguess who’s watching the vmars movie for the 5th time in the past 7 daysfalo que num quero mais saber dessa série mas é só ouvir o "a long time ago..." que larguei tdo igual uma fdp cadelinha de vmars que sou I was always confused with leronica and loronica and i was saying LoVe all the time 'cause thats what they say on the official ig of vmarsOKAY WTF IT’S WEIRD SEEING JEANNIE WITH HER BOYFRIEND CAUSE THEYRE VMARS AND VINNIE TO MY EYESthe fight scene in the vmars movie. im thankfulI’m off work and I think imma rewatch the vmars movie again I hope notShould i rewatch vmars again?🤔 😂😂😂 facts Just casually pointing out that the Vmars podcast has a real life lawyer check into all her detective work. But it's fine if you wanna miss out on something so great. 😂 I’ve enjoyed it. I got it for VMars. It also has all the Drag Race and Letterkenny and South Parkmight fuck around and rewatch the vmars movie for the 4th time this weekmy mom is live texting me s3 of vmarsI'm watching the good place for the first time and I know it's not Vmars but Kristen Bell is making me think of I love you babygirl 💖 vmars the movie i just watched it a third time I thought it was the VMars movie Revis definitely a better player but sherman will probably have the better career unless something happens we’ll see Well what you said is factual It says career thomight fuck around and rewatch the vmars moviewhen someone asks what was wrong with vmars season 4 and you try to summarize but it’s still a novel in their dms :/ sorry catching up back on vmars! lets get it Facts lol you were spot on with that, they need to hire ya ass  Is this your first time with VMars? (Aside from season 4) YEP. i’m pretty sure i made a vmars one The show had a cult following from 3 seasons b4 it was canceled, fans wait 7 years for a movie so they could see reunite,then they kill off character with the best character development in entire series (Logan)thought that would lead to more seasons? It killed it. like really i feel so insulted that the vmars writers thought any of that was acceptable. way to disrespect all ur fans- when u literally wouldnt have had a revival film w/o fan funding either????? fuck off!!!!! burnt marshmallows i stand w uMy LA friend ran into one of the VMars actors in the grocery store today. I got shamed and harassed. Come on LA! Why are you doing me like this?!!“It’s with a cam girl.” “That’s not even in pussy-grabbing range.” Seriously, VMars S4 keeps going for it. 2 out of 5 Alicias dancing. The dual sex shaming plans 🤮. Student correcting VMars what drug they used to rape someone 🤮. The random end of season 1 pick up of, oh yea V was raped we forgot about that for 19 episodes, oopsie. Keith was living his best live though 👍.cj in b99 is just the police version of vinnie van lowe in vmars Something tells me they’re that comfortable with it since it’s been months, nobody especially not fans want to speak of it again but they mention it again. Truth is, it was sloppy, no way vmars from the show would’ve come home with the backpack still in her car 😐 Yeah and the want to blame the fans for spoiling everyone 🙄 it was released early because it had already been spoilt. Sick of them lying like this.KRISTEN IN S3 VMARS YUPPPP That timeline is very helpful for the VMars fandom sleuths who are trying to solve the mystery of how they messed up our show this bad. don’t watch it. It’s not vmars. It’s some crack “feminist” bullshit that uses decades old misogynistic tropes and deviates from the strong female character they built for 10 years. Trauma porn and complete ignorance at its finest. literally nothing else to watch on the plane KSJSJSJD i started Chernobyl and fell asleep so i decided to hate watch vmarsVmars , hol and tgp are REALLY good but everythig else - Well... if you ain’t first you’re last
