Comics, Buffy, BSG, Star Wars, marvel, wynona Earp, vmars and a few moreVmars fans i need your help. Through the Kickstarter campaign i got a digital copy of the movie on Flixter, but I can no longer log in to the site and see the movie. Have I lost the movie or can I see it somewhere else? I'm in the EU 😊 hello people who read vmars fics what are your no 1 fave veronica and logan fics pls i need cheering up Logan in VMARS ALL THE WAY. Only in season 2 but definitely like Logan over Duncan. lmao i never saw this!! fnl, vmars (for our boy), b99, charmedso there is an account that posts lots of vmars scene packs like all the underrated characters and friendships agha catch me finally making the edit I always wanted to make but didn't want to download all the episodes i hope you mean gg and not vmarskinda wanna do an edit of the vmars title sequence but with twilight characters Hope you're both doing well. I look forward to listening. I just started reading the VMars books to fill the void.last episode of vmars here I go, I’m not ready for this Do we share a brain!? (Also, I’m rewatching VMars S1 right now)! Me too- VMars, Longmire, Lucifer and B99 were mine. We def can do it!! 💪💪 It was Chris's idea for us to start watching VMars! btvs, gilmore girls, game of thrones, vmars idek what shows you watch i only associate you with twilight KLFJSKLF buffy, the o.c., tvd, vmars vmars, misfits, lost girl, prison break new girl parks vmars jtv anyway, here you go with the full list: Babylon 5, X-Files, Simpsons, Wire, Buffy, Angel, Vmars, Arrested Development, Community, Parks, TVD, Justified, Magicians, and, ugh, the first half of Game of Thrones I GUESS That's what happens when creators engage with their fans. The fans stay loyal long after the show ends. Shows like GoT and VMars forgot that loyalty is a two-way street. Dead ass, and we just don’t have any way of knowing or trying to knowI want hulu to save bless this mess soooo bad but after they got involved in s4 of vmars idk what to think. i’m rewatching vmars rn ill probably rewatch it next bite me😌 and finish vmarsIt's becoming harder to keep my love for VMars alive, smdh. I kept thinking of VMars too even though I couldn't come up with details for what exactly brought it to mind Omg yes!!! Like you know how many times I must’ve written VMARS across an icon in something like Impact font cause it was 2003. He left most of the writing day to day to Diane, but the ending was all Rob and he steered the ship for each season... and he doesn't take input from his writers' room when he's off course. The ending of VMars was the dumb of iZ plus utter cruelty on top.finally watching the vmars movie!! I’m so excited for thisisa is about to finish vmars and i still don’t understand why she willingly put herself through it You starred in a poorly executed, claptrap soap operatic plot device that gave the 🖕 to a 15 yr fanbase, caused legitimate depression amongst its audience, killed the show permanently, put VMars in the pantheon of most reviled finales in history, but by all means, yuck it up. Have you finished watching all of it? ⚠️ Just a heads up— if you enjoy S1-3 and the movie, you might want to consider spoiling yourself before deciding to watch VMars S4. The majority of fans had a very adverse reaction. Many wish they had never watched. 💔 To be clear, I was talking S4. ⚠️ Just a heads up— if you enjoy S1-3 and the movie, you might want to consider spoiling yourself before deciding to watch VMars S4.

This... didn’t age well. 😬 I've only really been writing in the VMars fandom for about a year and I can say that everyone is really welcoming and there's such a diverse set of writing styles - we would love to have you :)Annie’s going to intern at the FBI? Did they steal this from unaired VMars s4?OH YES VMARS YOUTUBE!I KEEP FORGETTING WEEVIL CALLS HIS DICK LEGENDARY IN EPISODE ONE OF VMARS DGVJNFDXFHCGHVBJNKand the fact they name the episode where logan dies "Years, Continents, Bloodshed" is just a knife to the back i hate this so much, season 4 what season 4???? the vmars canon ends with the movie She did VMars the movie as a favour for Kristen (they met on You Again). But you know, so broke. Writing her children's books, doing her ad campaigns and TV.... Google is your friend but hey, I don't run a podcast and pretend to be an authority. Also, residuals look it up.the exact city and state I live in getting mentioned on vmars??? omg VMars fandom was kept alive almost exclusively by LoVe fans it seems like Agreed. But y'all spoiled vmars for me (thank you) so i never tuned in.So many choices in the vmars movie I dont understandMatty Ross is one of my favourite characters in VMars S4. smashed it.why do i have this sinking feeling na kung matuloy man season 5 ng Vmars, they're gonna have veronica pregnant,,, you know, bc she couldn't catch a break after what they did sa season finale, might as well right
