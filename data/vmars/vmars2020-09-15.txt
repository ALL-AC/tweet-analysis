 Please the Vmars sweet?? VMarsWorking at homewatching S3 of cuz u don't get a better 3rd season.I don't even have 2watch the first 2 seasons. It's S3, S4S6. I'm a happy shipper. What do u know, a showrunner who knew how to do a slowburnnot KILL the ending, unlike Vmars did. truly the riley finn of vmars. just the world's most forgettable character.the only vmars characters i can even name are logan, veronica, keith and lilly and thatâ€™s it lol I suggest asking VMARSi know more was said about vmars and i need to read and dig but iâ€™m so exhausted iâ€™m just not ready to be hurt more atm Ugh Iâ€™m so sorry! I have heard that about VMars, itâ€™s SO upsetting, like why? Why hurt your fans like that? I get character deaths, it obviously happens. But not in such absurd and meaningless ways! Girl I donâ€™t know but Iâ€™m so sorry the 100 pulled a VMars on yâ€™all. Itâ€™s made me so sad seeing all the tweets. Buffy and VMars, yes! That's what I like to see. :) Yeah but nobody should have to see their child burn to death in front of their face with nothing they can do. You would understand if you watched  Honestly same I havenâ€™t been able to get myself to watch vmars after that season 4As a casual viewer of The 100 who mostly would catch a live episode every now and then (catching up on the CW app), I'm glad I trusted my gut to wait to watch the final season. I have been jilted by a man in charge of a show before (*cough* VMars *cough*) and I knew Jason was...why does it feel like everyone a part of vmars hated logan? oh wait, because most fans cared about him more than veronica in the end because how much he changed and became a better person I don't even know if I'll ever be able to re-watch Vmars bc of her too Omg when TF did she say this I can't stand her I wrote her off after I finished Vmars season 4 I couldn't even watch the last season of The Good Place the sight of her face ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜  This situation reminds me kinda of what Rob Thomas did w/ VMars Logan. I feel like so many showrunners think you need a show to be dark gritty to be taken seriously when in reality thatâ€™s not the case. You can have ships that donâ€™t have tragic endings still be interesting! idk what vmars is isnt that the matt damon movie itâ€™s the one i told u has vmars vibes jcjdj but like itâ€™s lighterdoes it take anyone else a lot of courage to start a new show bc i simply canâ€™t bring myself to do it...anyways rewatching tgp,,, night rewatch vmars afterwardsI binge-watch all 4 seasons of Veronica Mars + movie about 2-3 times a year. I will never ever get sick of that show. Baby reminds me of when I was baby Hannah (in my 20s living in Scotland)... it's all a nostalgia bomb!  I'm adoring seeing your vmars tweets and every one that's about Logan is a Big MoodThere's this well known thing in tv where strong women must have violent things happen to them. They can't exist without the tragedy. (See: Buffy, VMars etc) Men on the other hand can only be tragic heros if all the women around them die. It's almost like we like hurting women. That is interesting cause I am still traumatized by Logan's death on Vmars. That as pretty bad. So di Maria in yazo kd baza mu kaishi vmars ba kenan ðŸ¤£sometimes if i am driving at night i worry someone will pop up in my backseat which is a result of both vmars the pilot episode of spn :/ All time: Buffy, angel, Smallville, VMars, Psych the ending of vmars (revival) hurt v bad as well Right. It took me until Smallville to notice the difference and then VMars. I was okay this is Aaron and Shawn got little differences you can see. Smallville, VMars, it is all Aaron. X-Men films it is all Shawn. My Brotherâ€™s Keeper they both basically played Eric, each other double. Lolthereâ€™s this scene in vmars season 3 where v is having a shit time and asks weevil to hit her over the head with his boot and honestly thatâ€™s how i feel rn
