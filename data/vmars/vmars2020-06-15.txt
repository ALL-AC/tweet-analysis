 Have you watched iZombie? Zombie police procedural. Great cast. Also done by Rob Thomas (creator of VMars) but less dark...even if it is with zombies. i mean by all series-of-locked-lj-posts-by-someone-with-an-unspecified-role-in-the-entertainment-industry accounts she was a fucking nightmare in the vmars days so you weren’t wrong Thanks dawg ! Gah, yeah. Cringe’s a potential thorn in anything a generation back, esp. if there’s a hint of zeitgeist in the DNA. I approach ‘em as artifacts, otherwise everything from Mary Tyler to Cagney Lacey to So-Called to VMars to Transparent might slide off the slope. 🙌🏻 It’s got enough positivity to not beat ya down these days. Also the music art direction *chef’s kiss* I’m currently rewatching Vmars! I haven’t seen S3 wow would give it to me. I think she is also on a rewatch. There’s a bit of cringe to its age. Swell, I’m back in. HACF was a summer show on AMC in the first place, so the timing’s good. I’d watch Bishé act out the phone book, anyway. (And she was great in Weiner’s Romanoffs.) Re-watching VMars now, btw. Another Tait fam all-timer. Haven’t seen the movie or S4, so, wheee! Not yet. VMars is too adult. It was almost too much for me. I think Buffy might be good next time. JDJBDDJKDDN ON PARTY DOWN IM REWATCHING IT BC I HAVENT WTSHCED IT SINCE VMARS AND A BUNCH OF ACTORS ARE ON IT , ONE BEING KEITH MARS WHO WHIPS OUT HIS DICK . yeah it's pretty fascinating how comparatively impoverished it is. the list is like ... vmars, terriers ... i think lodge 49 is beach noir, basically. and...?that one scene in vmars where veronica and lily are in the pool floating in water lilies makes me cry every fucking timefinally watching the vmars movie 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 f:( text me and we can have fanfic discussions! not abt vmars bc i’ve never read? seen? that, but yk. it fun! sdgbbbgr ok thanks and vmars bc i was not happy w how they k*lled off a fave character at the end I choose to believe his iZombie character is who turned up in the Vmars moviethe fact that they made logan a military operative or whatever after og vmars ended was truly top five tv betrayals pls you can’t win and i apologize for encouraging u to watch vmars and dc we lost so bad
