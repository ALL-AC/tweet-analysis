 sounds like a move ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Wouldnâ€™t know thanks for telling methe song that plays during the vmars epic scene is on the work radio, as if i wasnâ€™t already on the verge of tears"The mayor's a big VMars fan." US TOO! tessa thompson on vmars........ i loved her then i love her now Iâ€™d kill for a VMars sketch tall t vmars time Amen bro!!!!  she rarely reminds me of her on vmars honestly which is impressive bc eleanor is the same genre of character, meanwhile jason dohring only has the same 3 tics he uses every time in a screenThat finale of honestly made my heart happy. I'm so thankful for such a wellwritten, funny, heartwarming and thoughtprovoking show. â™¥ Plus I get to see my fav on my tv every week and not just on my big VMars poster. â™¥  'flat? the way god made me' a top tier vmars moment imo LISTEN, the first time I met Tessa was right after the VMars Movie came out and I talked to her at length about it after she sang at JMU. She was super lovely and said she had an audition in NY the next day because she wanted to start acting again. She did the damn thing.
