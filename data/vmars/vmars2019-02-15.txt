 It wouldn’t be VMars without him! Hey VMars! What up? jess if she comes out as a chair shipper i literally will not watch the vmars revival They did a sudden death round this morning. 30 minutes starting at 7 am (where I live anyway). I think the VMars fandom just missed it. ☹️ At least I didn't know about it until it was over... 🌽 Tell that to my pop’s alma mater Hotshot Nation 🔥💉 Yep Salt lake baby I’m basically the VMars of design tbh Out here reviving squad Well that was just unnecessary. was just trying to politely let you know you used the term incorrectly. Also a true VMars fan would want to get the term right.thinking abt the new vmars series and how, no matter what happens, it might just ruin me completely as a person. Fair Way ahead of yous Let’s kill him Have just rewatched all of VMars again in the last week. I am ready for more now! snowboarding? I love you. I got to enter and spin the wheel! Help AND get a chance to live that VMars life? ALL THE YES. I completely agree with Tara. It's very fun -- the alien powers are shown beautifully. It's very 90s nostalgic vibe, but 2019 content. LOVE the main actor, Jeanine Mason. I wasn't a die hard for the original, so I might be less picky, but I love it. Major VMars vibes 😍 tu já viu vmars? recomendo the oc was the Ultimate when it came to indie soundtracks but one tree hill and veronica mars really came through too. i first heard “such great heights” on vmars. Correct! Also bonus points for the VMars gif ;) is also my favorite. And as much as I enjoy the thrill of reading stories where no one is safe, at this point of world terribleness, I'm pretty set on keeping all my lovely queer disaster spies alive. I’m pretty sure this is the opposite of an unpopular opinion😂 isn’t this the one thing every VMars fan agrees on? Or am I insane?! Surprise pizza rolls* Yessir and nick foles still the last QB to throw a TD in the super bowl. Eagles still the reigning champs if ya ask me 🦅🦅🦅 Ill give u OTH VMars since those were WB shows, izombie was ok from what i saw though Wanted to write, but ended up really just vegging... Kind of disappointed. But will be doing a VMars rewatch with my sister soon! 😊 started it!! will continue when i’m done vmars 3 Dan Etheridge is the VMars producer who sent the script to him.
