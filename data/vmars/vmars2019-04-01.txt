 Sweet. Watching the VMars movie but it's about to go off and I need something new to watch 😎Lo feliz que sería yo teniendo Buffy, Angel, VMars y Alias en streaming Love FNL and VMars. Don't forget the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series... true. whedon can choke lmao but vmars will be the next show i watch. i'll probably drop tvd before i finished so vmars will be my escape. is that show getting a reboot too? everything is getting a reboot these days A+ list just finished FNL ssns 5/6 are my favorites Suggestions: if you like VMars/Riverdale try Pretty Little Liars (moderately diverse cast) Nancy Drew meets teen Twin Peaks (high camp noir). For incredible dialogue, Felicity. Also gets award for most Hot actors named Scott I LoVe tgen all. Thank you for bringing us more Veronica Mars. I got Hulu as soon as I saw that VMars was coming back. Thank you! 💕 Maybe the reason why I remember you were recapping VMars (beside the Mandela Effect) is because you were active on the forums? Also trying to decide weather or not I wanted vmars too I have always said Seth and Ryan were my favorite love story of my teen years!!! Also VMars was life! Buffy (and it’s spinoff Angel). I grew up on them as they originally aired on TV. And it was still Buffy that led me to Veronica Mars, as Joss Whedon (Buffy’s creator) was a huge fan of VMars and recommended the show (not to mention his cameo in S2). Lmao omg I’ve pretty much run out of people 😂 family members...friends...all on the VMars bandwagon. Maybe my next steps is handing it Veronica Mars pamphlets to strangers? 🤣 but then watching with them would not exactly be safe haha Nossa, ela nem pra me contar Mas blz né Quem sou eu pra reclamar de mais vmars It’s never good to rush it, you could become desensitized to the real thing You’re out here throwing batting practice Sock? Shower drain? Not sure if you knew that there was a call out to VMars moving to the CW in season 2 finale... When Clarence kills Aaron, Duncan answers the phone "CW" and Clarence answers "Done deal" Another podcast I listen to brought it up. Pretty cool, I thought! It was the 2018 VMARS "New Technology forum" of course........😋 me with a gun to his head: force them to make another vmars season him: i'm not even close to being in charge o- me: DO IT the jury duty 12 angry men episode rules! tbh all the episodes that are just the vmars take on classic movies are great, esp. the "rashomon at a high school fun fair" ep from season 2 Looks like your gonna have to get a dog then Get a dog broSince, Is also releasing in July, it's gonna be 2 packed days for me 😏 1 day 1 day  YESSS!! We just compared Roswell to Vmars on our live yesterday! Such iconic shows! 👏🏻👏🏻 can y’all upload the vmars seasons already i’m tiredpast few years been so beautiful for my buffy/dawson’s creek/angel/ parks/ vmars heart. ALL THEM REUNIONSSSSSSS Yes, please ❤ Never left the VMars fandom. Still in the DRW fandom, but not too focused. VMars is bae, but HARD. B99 I avoided for a long time, but my worst fears were the opposite of reality! (Not saying “must watch” but just, I have strong feels about these two. Most of the others I haven’t seen either) Big fan. ~6 years ago, pledged ~ to help Kickstart The VMars Movie Prjct. Recently, family moved, but after unpacking, cannot find the poster! Searched hi and low. Prized possession, gone. Is there any way team VMars could sign and send a new poster please? You can still get VMars on iTunes, so it's kind of weird.YIKES. There’s more. The plagiarist had 5 works posted on AO3... ALL of them were nicked from old Twilight fics on FFN. BTW, this is happening in VM (not VMars) fandom. Hahaha oops. I’ve seen vmars like 4 times through so that’s an extra sad miss on my partgreat thing that happened to me today, I posted a vmars gif on the main and a random ass man tweeted back to me with another gif and said “I thought I’d share the original reference with you” and it’s like shut the fuck up dude!!!!!!!!!!!!! god why!!!!!!!!!!!! If anything pick up an Back in the draft Agholor desean and Jeffery is a top 3 wr core in the league Jordan Howard isn’t all that.... solid back but we don’t need him waste of money Stupid idea vmar very bad
