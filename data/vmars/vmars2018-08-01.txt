 Well someone set my Veronica Mars addict brain off again, but to stop myself from going down the rabbithole I am rewatching iZombie which is just an AU version of vmars. With zombies. You could watch that.During VMars anniversary, I was talking excitedly about when this person, suddenly chimed in said, "I have never seen Veronica Mars. I just dont like teen shows because they're suck. I don't like KBell too. She is the sloth girl, rite? But I did like Gossip Girl." just discovered VMars novels! So glad you narrated! Any new books in the making?? This is more an ensemble cast but the female half of the slow burn is a kick ass detective if that helps. This is one of those shows where if any one of the cast were missing it would feel off balance. True definition of an ensemble. PS I also saw someone suggest VMars (DO IT) VMars is legit my fav show of all time. Thank you G! Pay me in gumvmars - s1 is one of the best and most consistent seasons of tv any show ever - veronica mars - logan x veronica - veronica x lilly + veronica x wallace - kristen bell - 9/10 Bro so weird 😂😂😂 With maybe even a mini vmars along the way !!! Out doing her mom every chance shes got and having grandpa ;) helping his grandchild:P could be funny!!!Just finished by and 👏👏👏 As a fan since VMars, I geeked out a about the release. As a wannabe writer, I am envious of the talent. As a lover of thrillers, I was enthralled and entertained. So so good. rewatching vmars s3 and man, armie hammer showing up is such a blastI just read number 3 scully/mulderOTP jadzia dax ginny tonks jigglypuff meowth james vmars mac hannigramLike is up there with Buffy, Vmars, and Dawson's Creek as one of my favorite shows growing up, And Michael and Maria are like one of my OTPs, so I'm really protective of that show, and the trailer just looked TERRIBLE in comparison to the original. Last question is from Janet and Bad Janet and D'arcy is losing her mind. Their question is whether VMars would go to the good place and KBell says definitely. Deep Lilly Kane is really living her life. I knew she’d be a star. rewatching parks and rec would be so weird now that i’ve watched adam scott as a manipulative and charismatic sexual predator in both vmars and flower hhh It’s funny coz I had no idea who she was before Frozen (didn’t really remember her from Heroes) but after my brother made me see it I got curious and binged all of VMars, bought the movie, watched all of House of Cards aaand now we have this show LMAO. She’s amazing ❤️ hey whats up I've watched and loved Vmars It was a terrible season of VMars and I am so sad she had to partake in it. I DIE. Remember when she was on VMars and everyone hated her? She just doesn’t understand That kinda looks like you Why are you tryna find one...“I wouldn’t be here if I thought you did it”  I THINK I NEED TO JUMP ON THIS VMARS REWATCH BANDWAGON
