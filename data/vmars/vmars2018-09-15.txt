 Lmaoooooooo 😂 vmars and lost but also shocked you don’t watch this is us but i literally would never recommend someone binge watching that show you’d be an emotional mess. vmars is so Goodi just started watching poi and why is papa mars here? i love papa mars and vmars so much Deadass😂😂 couldn’t be meeeee I really caught everyone slipping Lmaooooo can i get the Keenan one while we’re at it where that video of buhl 😂😂😂 Fair enough, I guess I can let Rob Thomas off seeing as we might get more VMars on the screen 😏😋I think the writers of have been reading my fanfiction because the story is very similar 😂 "His ex girlfriend is married to the mob boss". Everyone, please read my Veronica Mars fic 'To Neptune And Back' and leave some reviews to make me happy 🤩  Logan *immediately* looks for VMars. He knows better than anyone that she is beyond her prim ways now, and he stays in her crosshairs (by design, I'm sure) . Remember when security footage was on VHS? Pullimg up ep 1x01 for ! I’ll keep u updated Glooks my g! GOD BIG MOOD before all the nonsense in s4 of Iz I was always reccing vmars and planning to buy the dvd and now I’m just like ‘ew’ again, it's been forever since i last tried vmars and i might be misremembering, on top of that because god know my memory is Garbage, so who knows though tbh iz has kind of soured me on rob thomas lately so i might not bother. i didn't when i watched it, like, a billion years ago and honestly, nothing i've seen about vmars since has made me like it anymoreI always forget Paris Hilton was in VMars.The Alterna-Prom scene in Vmars is too much emotion for 1am 💔VMars Poll: What hurts more?one day i'll give vmars a second chance when i'm not still preemptively bitter about veronica ending up with logan instead of either of the dudes she actually has chemsitry withwho is still asking for more vmars?? dude! Are you going to be in the new series? I’ll be extremely disappointed if Dick Casablancas isn’t backThe Good Place has already wrapped season three before it's even aired. Wowowoww. (they seem to shoot so fast, aka Kristen has so much time for this VMars revival)watching vmars seasons 2 and 3 the library never has season 1, i should see if it's lost or smth Ack this is hard! Off the top of my head: Veronica/Logan - Vmars Bel/Freddie -The Hour Lyla/Riggins - Friday Night Lights Felicity/Ben - Felicity Rory/Jess - Gilmore GirlsZita hates her mom for murdering a tech CEO and destroying their family. But when Zita unravels a conspiracy that endangers her mom’s life, she must decide if she’s willing to sacrifice herself to save the person she can’t forgive. Black Mirror x VMars Zita hates her mom for murdering a tech CEO and destroying their family. But when Zita unravels a conspiracy that endangers her mom’s life, she must decide if she’s willing to sacrifice herself to save the person she can’t forgive. Black Mirror x VMars I was at the beach with no cell service drinking margaritas all day so I missed everyone who tagged me the VMars news. Good looking out peeps. I LoVe you all.VMac is not okay. Also, that is too close to VMars who was actually awesome.  😂😂😂jimmy BUT honorable mentions... Logan Veronica (VMars) Don Sloan (The Newsroom) Anne Capt. Wentworth (Persuasion) ALL the ships in Sense8 Katniss Peeta (THG) also Stelena, Bellarke, Cophine, Milathos, OK SO I COULD KEEP GOING. Yea that’s why it’s hard. Those arent my 5 favorite shows but I was trying to get across the spectrum. Then realized VMars and Buffy are kinda similar. And that Criminal Minds and The Following are also similar. I hope so but we'll see. What you said was in that excerpt. I hope it's not just a slightly longer VMars the movie. what why? VMars was good at the one big mysteryShit - Bojack Horseman or Clone High should also be here. Maybe take off Parks Rec and VMars? I think VMars and Dexter had two of the most perfect first seasons. NOOOOOOO. I forgot VMars. What is wrong with us?! h*lu pls add vmars so i can rewatch the whole showthe love makeout scene against the wall in the vmars movie.....................................................god tierwhy is the vmars movie not streaming anywhere i don't deserve this Sneak in chumbRewatching VMars! I love this show! I loved her so so much during vmars days. Can barely stand her now :/ Omg VMars forever!! Love that show!! ❤❤❤ I was told to skip S3 so I did. I read VMars fic though
