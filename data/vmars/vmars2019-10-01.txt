 look, she posted BEFORE VMars S4 went up that it was what fans deserved, not what they wanted. as far as I'm concerned she killed Logan EchollsI feel bad for the people who never read the vmars books...y’all, we find out why the navy meant so much to Logan and what he went through after veronica left. Veronica has a brother. Like, cmon, the books fed usUM the politician theme song is the LoVe song from the vmars movie this is rUDEAll the non cussing in VMars season four is giving me mad vibes. (Which, by the way, I have been binging this week and am so sad to be coming in as it's ending - good KoB ongoing games are hard to come by and y'all are great) Bro deadass 😂😂😂😂😂😂 did you even watch the last ep of vmars or did you just give upI can’t hear “quid pro quo” without thinking of vmarsI think imma go back and watch some vmars once im caught up on tgp My So Called Life, Roswell (the original idk if the new one has it), I also haven’t seen anyone mention Peep Show yet but maybe I missed it. Felicity, VMars and AD were the others that came to mind but those have been mentioned.TMW you realize the kid from Kazaam (the Shaq one, not Shazam-the-Zac-Levi one) is Weevil from VMars. 🤯 I think I will. in all honesty, season 4 of vmars really fucked me up and I haven’t been the same sinceSo I’m back on the VMars grind. AS IF this prisoner experiment ever would have passed an institutional review boardnow I wanna reread the vmars books Same with the VMars stickers... It’s so good and the cast is incredible. You like VMars, so you’ll probably dig this.All eight of my VMars stickers are still waiting to be stuck to something and now lolololololol But I did buy myself a spiffy 3 ring binder with page protectors to store all my stickers, and it's the perfect thing to put stickers on!Two dreams: Sekou was breaking down defenders with his dribble and scoring easily. A Buffy, Veronica Mars, Saved by the Bell crossover. Zach reached out to Buffy and VMars to help investigate some not so funny happenings at Bayside High.I’m ready to go home and watch my fave vmars episodesYou know how sometimes a dog thinks she hears something and starts barking, and that immediately makes another dog start barking too? That's just what happened to me and . 😂😂😂 We will defend our VMars feelings from naysayers both real and imaginary. 😆😆😆my sister’s laughing at me on the phone because of how positive I tried being about vmars season 4 and how bad I got screwed over. this happens once a weekI'm listening to a podcast episode from last year, and these people are super excited about the VMars reboot and I just figured out that if I could go back in time the only thing I would do would be to sabotage Rob Thomas. has taught me that just because you’re a doesn’t mean you can’t be badass. In fact knowing that you are a and embracing it makes you a badass. So Happy Anniversary VMars. So glad to have you back ❤️apparently logan dies in the new vmars season and i was putting watching it off bc of school but now im just going to pretend they never did revive that show Ah, the VMars approach to TV!kristen kinda pena que peguei ódio desde vmars rs I like the Pretenders. I just think they tried to make VMars sound like a Bond film, which isn’t what I like about VMars. sad vmars ended after the movieI was always like wtf vmars is older than me in 25 days and now it’s the first time I celebrate their anniversary as a marshmallow and it’s so weird and I love it🤧💗💖💘I feel so tiny oof😂 like vmars and lost where out today 15 years ago and it’s exactly 25 days before my bday and I feel soooo young wth🤧 Such a great tb it’s on hulu baby!! so after rewatching vmars, u can watch it (as well as buffy!!!!!!)Finished the VMars revival and I have to say I really enjoyed it. It needed more Weevil and Wallace but that's my only complaint. I cannot muster the motivation to watch it, after the reviews and after the end of VmarsI have dead ass started so many new shows since I finished VMars bc I can’t find anything that brings me real joy 😭Saying VMars acted in character for S4 because she never got therapy.? She did get therapy. Remember when Clarence Wiedman took those bullseye pictures of VMars? She was at therapy. Also, What degree did she get in New York? Bachelor of Arts, Psychology. OWNAGEthe only valid part of s4 vmars is the use of can’t take my eyes off of you as the bgm of logan’s fight sceneAs my need to closely analyze every little bit of Veronica Mars S4 (and my compulsion to understand the "burnts") slows down, I want to have a thread here about VMars True Facts. Just a place to list my final thoughts and takeaways from the past two months of hubbub. I just decided to rewatch the series! Season 1 episode 1 on now!  I loved how Girl Meets World added something new and fresh on the story even if I disagreed with certain plots related to the BMW folks. Gilmore Girls I was never a big enough fan of to care. But VMars Reboot hurt. It physically hurt. So Butters (in S2) was not wrong. When I watched the VM movie the first time I didnt know who Adam Johnson was. Having watched , , and I freaked out rewatching it. I believe I said 'Holy shit its Adam Johnson!' Thanks for making the VMars movie that much better! Seasons one and two of VMars have been fantastic!! Agents of Shield is still my favorite but it’s kinda lost direction... or something. The Good Place is SO good!!!Also, as a side note, I'm reading a lot of VMars fanfiction right now. I need the happy. I'm re-reading some of my old favorites, but searching for new ones too! So, if you got a LoVe story for me to read, please share it!Binged a rewatch of the original and then the movie. Now I have been watching the new VMars... Its a lot different. 🤔i finally finished s4 vmars and yes i regret it VMars is my fave - have you gotten to season 4 yet!? Me neither. My mom would have been with me but she passed away 6 years ago. I have 1 friend who loves VMars but she hasn’t watched S4 yet (getting her bf caught up 1st) she has me blocked on here til she does… she’ll prob think I’m crazy if she goes back to read it all! Love Vmars.
