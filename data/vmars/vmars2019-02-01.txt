 Walk up thenthis is absolutely destroying me... vmars is such a good show but so heartbreakingthe vmars season two finale... i'm speechless whenever you get the chance watch it. im not sure if it's there anymore but if the go90 app is available in canada, all the episodes of vmars is there.I had forgotten that a mini series of Vmars is on the way and I just remember and I am very happy now.the fact that hulu is bringing back the seasons of vmars in the summer is perfection. they are really doing this shit exactly as it should be done. I think they keep it to 13 episodes on purpose, probably for both actor and story reasons. (This is one of the reasons KBell can film VMars!!)i have no words... in izombie 4x10 enrico colantoni (who plays vmars' dad) makes a hamilton reference, dies, then ravi and liv make die hard references right after... WE And I would love a modern day Nancy Drew show, but it’s gonna be difficult to succeed without the comparisons to VMars. Not intentionally, but ppl will bring it up unconsciously. It might be good, so we’ll see Mark, can you give us any clue as to who will be on the final podcast of season 3? Any hint? Would love to have KB, but she's still filming the Hulu VMars revival series 😫🤞 I am really hoping Ryan is part of a special VMars week like they did with The Good Place ♥️💪🏻🍒 I can’t imagine rob thomas or the cast would settle for anything less...they’ve been pretty faithful to the original VMars vision Yessir I remember that was crazy how you nailed it! oh what a night that was baby! 🦅🦅🦅I forgot that Logan from VMars was in this episode of Supernatural. Or Spider-Man Couldn’t agree more even just with this i remember i thought he was doing a very specific and beautiful performance in vmars and then i also remember that's just how he isCan we get , , and any other musically gifted alum into a musical? (I am not suggesting a musical, but rather something new) I have no idea. I think when they did the VMars one they needed The WB's permission? sunday? Thanks cuz 😂❤️ I know that first pic is not of , like anyone forgot she was there....literally anytime I see her in anything, my first thought is “oh, Jackie from VMars” But i guess yea now more than ever cause he’s pretty nice now Just always really enjoyed the guy i didn’t really say anything about how good he was
