 Thankyou for your continued hard work! i hope everyone is prepared for vmars to come back like you did not know me when i spent all my time watching my dvd boxsets on repeat Bueno, VMars es una de mis favoritas de todos los tiempos, que la revivan me hace feliz jajajaja.Omg djdjdjdjdj I'm so hyped for Vmars yessss!!! me too!! i'm so happy she found a new friend, who probably gonna help her through her own personal issues. i missed mac, tho. those LoVe scenes got me so excited!! same old vmars, i can't wait fçdgfkjkfdgdkhmçl Just saw it. They seem to be taking parts of the book + putting it into the show, but it doesn't seem exactly the same, So excited 4 the LoVe scenes + that Vmars is going 2 explore how she self-sabotages her relationships + SOO GLAD she has a new female friend. Please please please will someone tell me if and when this is being released in the UK. There is more Vmars fans passed the US continent I have faith she will pick Logan. What are these books? I need to add them to my list. It's been so long since I immersed myself in VMars. I watched it when it was airing live 😂😂gotta be honest though, i was singing the vmars theme as i got dressed this morning and haven’t watched an episode of that show in like over a yearthe vmars trailer omgNEW VMARS TRAILERRR And this is why I couldn't keep watching VMars, I prefer a comic foil who's not a Hliarious Misogynist. just found you and really love the show. Keep up the good work. I found vmars while working at a local UPN affiliate in IL and never looked back.  70% but i still gotta watch vmars and of lost i watched like 3 seasons out of order rip Can you imagine if they bring out Vmars ones?? I can't believe this was 15 years ago. If you'd told me this was between VMars and Good Place, I'd have believed you. Ha, that’s so great! I was just there for the VMars panel, but I want to go next year for real. MY LINDSAY MY SHARP SAVVY BIRTHDAY BABY!!!!!!! I am overjoyed to share an earth with you, and interests with you, a whole ass life with you. May this new year bring you VMars that ignores season 3’s characterization and lots of patios to enjoy the sunset on. ❤️💜 fuck I forgot it was midnight I'm watching vmars again I mean i believe she was in American idol for 9 episodes and she guest starred on vmars.///oops started a vmars rewatch/// gonna be 10% when I watch more vmars sksksksks opposites attract 3I know I said I was going to rewatch VMars when I finished Lucifer but ummmmm what if I just watch Lucifer again  I think it is so very brave of you to share this, it feels like my own story. Just so you know, not that it matters to most, I NEVER believed a single word of those rumors and I keep wishing you'll show up as Adam Newman once again! You were the best!!! I also watched VMars so 😁what i mean by that is, like, i think a lot of Discourse about vmars talks about it's noir roots as a subtextual, inverted thing, but it's all actually pretty transparent--the visual cues and gender roles are flipped but it's not hinting at anything. it's all right there on top VMars themed party? We are going to have a VMars marathon and eat marshmallows and you're going to love it. Yes!!!! VMars is fantastic!mixed feelings bcos im gonna miss the good place sm but also vmars will be backcan june be over already i need vmars month NOW Before Laurel Lance, there was Duncan Kane, legit the worst character of all time ever - badly written, badly acted. The actor was so bad he quit Hollywood altogether months after he was written out of VMars. He's a lawyer now. Hahaha I'm always afraid of that ~temptation potential, but it's really a godawful episode in every way. It's boring on top of bad. It's VMars version of a Laurel Lance gets the spotlight episode.We just saw a VMars clip and it was soooo good, the voice is still so unique and perfect Plus I'm hoping for Vmars just to go full revival. I couldn't do it. I was so disappointed. VMars is proof that a show that is created with soley one arch should only be a one season show. They set up nothing for a second season and it showed horrifically. See also: Battlestar Galactica. ok, needing VMars bitmoji!yeah is it july 26th yet i need vmars back in my life VMars - yes! Can't wait for the mini series :-) How many years after the movie is the new Season of VMars? Okay, that's what I figured. VMars probably won't be Hall H if they're Hulu, then...literally every part of that scene from vmars is a masterpiece 2010's writers could never reach the level of excellence Seriously , who’s yanking your chain and ours? ⛓🤨 ? ? ? Only 53 days until new episodes... 📆⏱ Marshmallows need a steady diet of “classic” ASAP! 💚🤞💚🤞💚🤞💗 BELOVED, when I finish Lucifer imma have to rewatch VMars Thanks! My three fin de siècle cultural touchstones: Buffy (), VMars (), and Anything The Queen Is In (). Nice vmars gif deployment there, friend. YAS LANEY. this made my heart so happy. i wore my vmars kickstarter shirt during my stream last night. i’m doing a rewatch with my bff, we’re in season 2! Funny people say that, my mind went to Riverdale before VMars.
