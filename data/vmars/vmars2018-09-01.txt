 thanks brotha ! i wish i could come tailgate "An" envelope. Can't make money without being on the ball. LolWhy didn't anyone insist I watch iZombie before now? It's so good on its own, but I am also here for all the VMars references and cameos. On season 3 now, and Logan Echolls is bringing zombie viiiiiibes. s1 vmars duh Say no more Totally agree thats why s1 of VMars was something very special. Correct trailer should be like that only bring that S1 and somewhat S2 flavor with Adult Veronica That's true. Plenty of good VMars crossover on FFNet but not many people realized it. I wrote lots of them, but unless people click the crossover button, they won't know. it was playing in the nail salon i was in and for like 20 minutes i was so confused as to why the vmars movie had so much less detective work than expected You’re killing me with all these character quotes! VMars AND Lady Julia Grey?? 😍😍😍did i just rewatch the vmars epic scene? yeah... did i almost start crying at work? yeah Thanks Brodie ‼️ is the VMars rumor true? I am going to cry now. Get me a part of the show? 😂😩😂😩😂  I dunno why Lorne is biased against TV star KBell. What about movie star KBell? Girl has VMars as both her movie and show.The more I think about this VMars revival, the more I think I only want it if it involves an adaptation of The Liberation of Katie Holmes. 💯 especially since we got a Vmars movie. The fact that you still haven't watched Vmars makes me sad. You would like it!Se o próprio Rob Thomas postou a notícia do possível revival de VMars estar mt próximo de acontecer, é pra ficar empolgado, né? I’m torn. On one hand more VMars. On the other, the movie did a good job of wrapping up storylinesUghhhhhh the movie was so fucking good!!!! vmars action scenes are the actual best! 😍😍😍 Just so you know, I am expecting stickers of “I saved VMars” this time too. And a t-shirt… But mostly the stickers. She left a vacuum in VMars that they never filled in S23. I very much agree and would love that. I've been on her team since VMars/Mean Girls and I've seen the majority of the stuff she's done in the dark years....largely, because I'm a fan. Lord knows Letters to Juliet was misery.Amanda Seyfried's been steadily working, landing lead roles in romances and YA genre stuff and supporting roles in studio comedies and Oscar stuff, and if you'd told me she hadn't done anything between 2004 (Mean Girls/VMars) and 2017 (Twin Peaks) I'd have believed youcast Sheryl Lee in the VMars sequel I watched the whole thing. Many of the panel members are still fans of VMars and wants to have a revival. But some of them are way off base regarding Logan vs other characters, as always. These journalists, man. I actually give the VMars the movie gofund campaign , now I have the movie poster signed by the whole cast. all my hopes are dashed. the vmars revival is all that’s left for me now One big question I would have for a Veronica Mars reboot is the given the large of VMars cameos in iZombie will we get iZ cameos in Veronica Mars? Yes! I have all seasons of VMars on DVD. Got them when I supported the movie 😊 Loved that show. Still love it so much! X-Files, VMars... yeah ya know what I don't know if I want it or not but I'm ready for that Fringe revival. Anytime now TV industry.... anytime now. and vmars is at its heart a story about systemic inequality, something notoriously hard to escape. that veronica did, but chooses to return with more knowledge and ammunition to try to make sure there’s some justice? that’s a cool arc for me. i’m excited to see where it goes Hahah I hated it and quit watching 🙈🙈 I just couldn’t get on board with the characters at all. I’ve heard it gets better but I’m impatient lol. I’ve always wanted to watch VMars I adore VMars, but I'm not sure I need more. Season 3 was a mixed bag (with some great moments, don't get me wrong). I also know I've seen the movie but don't know anything about it. The Good Place is killing it right now. I have no connection to VMars. And new place is da best. Ah, thanks. (Opinion: I love VMars, loved it, but I think its time has passed, tbh.) Why are people talking about VMars today?I don’t care about your take. I’m literally fighting back the urge to scream/sob at the idea of VMars coming back.I mean I loved VMars and I'll watch the revival, but like...there are so many other shows I can think of that were cancelled and didn't get a proper ending yet. for example...im trying not to get my hopes up for the vmars revival but i cant stop thinking about a possible lily flashback or dream sequence and you cant tell me it wouldnt work cos its been 13 years when amanda seyfried doesnt look a day older than she did in 2005Oh boy am I glad twitter didn't exist when VMars was on. Ahh yes. Add VMars to the list of things we have in common 😂there might be a VMars revival and I am so here for it!I’m sorry y’all but vmars is all I’m gonna be tweeting about for awhile. I’m so happy, and this show got me through one of the toughest times in my life. Veronica was the first female character I aspired to be. The writing and show resonated with me back then and still does today I think it was before I started doing TV Club because it might have been one of the things that got me interested in VMars(not so secretly hoping that if we do get the revival that maybe we'll also get another VMars book someday. I loved reading those, !)  I think if (and when !!!) that happens all us loVe and vmars fans will faint at oncesuper thrilled for vmars renewal. if it sucks i'll just pretend the movie is the finale. hjfdjdjfOkay, so that VMars news was small potatoes compared with the other news, but it all makes me !!!!I LITERALLY CANT BREATHE WTF VMARS However, VMars is a fandom that still exists and is relatively active whereas most of the other reboots are from long gone properties that an exec decides to reboot based on spreadsheet numbers. Hey! Perfect opportunity to do a recap of all VMars and then do the new show! Pleeeease My Veronica Mars views for the record: S1 AND S2 are PERFECT S3 tweaked the format, didn't work as well but there's still a LOT of good there and I'd watch 10 seasons at that level quality and be happy The movie had its moments but mostly proved VMars doesn't work as a movietoday i turned 30 and manafort/cohen/hunter PLUS vmars happened how about deez nutzok, so vmars wasn't bad!! i love it to this day, but generally speaking it was a show that i feel like could only work in the mid 2000s. it had that whedon brand of writing and that idea that torturing the tiny blonde female lead makes her feisty attitude even better.Fml, fml, fml, fml omg. the only person who is probably as excited as I am for the VMars/Hulu news is WHY ARENT YOU FREAKING OUT YET!? Some of us followed for the vmars and the socialism is just icingHoly shit we might be getting more VMars I’m not okokay but if hulu is rebooting vmars why is it still not available to stream???? I was sad relistening to the final podcast about last week because everyone seemed so hopeful that the movie wouldn't be the end. It had been so long I didn't expect this news but I am giddy with excitement now.i could pause my ceg rewatch and start a vmars rewatch instead...the vmars revival is the only revival that truly matters HULU IS CURRENTLY FINALIZING A DEAL TO BRING BACK VMARS THIS IS NOT A DRILL YOU LOVE VMARS TOO????????????????????????????????? As much as I'd want it, they at least got a chance to wrap it up and end the show with some grace even though it'd been cancelled. All the storylines got endings, and it was heartwarming and beautiful. VMars ended with a WTF and didn't touch on ANY of it in the film.me: I love vmars hulu: we're gonna have an 8 episode revival me: whyGuilty sleazeballs around Trump going down and new VMars on Hulu is a good way to turn this 💩 month around. Robbie mate! Love the cast of izombie especially my boi make sure you give them cameos in the new VMars series 👍But also some of these reboots are things no one asked for and people literally spent like on a VMars movie bc we'd been asking for a continuation for so long so... I think that factors in as well.kristen bell and jason dohring content is coming to us soon I HAVE NO WORDS YOU GUYS. MY THREE VMARS MUTUALS MAKE SOME NOISE probably not?? i feel like she'll be able to do both since comedies require less film time / vmars will probably only be a couple eps + they both film in cali!revivals are a big Hit or Miss (usually miss) but i'm always here for more vmars Have you watched iZombie? It doesn't give me quite the INTENSE FEELS of a good VMars binge but it's also by Rob Thomas and uses a lot of the same actors. It feels sort of like if Veronica Mars and Buffy (the shows, not the women) had a show baby. Thank you for playing Weevil and brought the character to life. You played an important character. Representation matter ✊🙂 Let's hope you and your character will return in the next revival, right ? (I hope you read the books 😽)she was 1 of my first crushes ive been in love with her since i saw her on vmars gilmore girls. i rmbr being shocked that she was cast as jessica jones cos ive only seen her do comedy but she was amazing as always i shouldnt have doubted her. we stan a hot legend it's OK they aren't that good but if you want a little more VMars in your life then they're acceptable 😅 i watched the 3rd VMars season live but didn't watch the first two until years later when it was on Netflix (rip) bc clearly i didn't know what i was missing???? now i have them all on DVD (along w buffy 2, 3, 4, 6 🙈) vmars trivia ?????? I only love Rob Thomas (VMars, Izombie) tbh My 💩list includes but is not limited to Shonda (Greys) Plec (although she gave me everything DE-related) KevW, Darlton (Lost), Bays/Thomas (How I Met Your Mother). Everyone involved with That 70's Show, JROT (The100) 🤣They all suck! Vince new nickname is Charmen. Lol  Thanks. Sometimes I am on the VMARS net Wednesday night on 3615 USB. Sur côté got t’es un fou mec sinon il y a viking Les soprano boardwalk of empire et vmars c est top ah oui californication série a voir sans modérationmax greenfield’s character on vmars is so different from schmidt on new girl i wish it wasn’t so funny after u finish watching vmars ur brain expands so much u gain the ability to read 🧠 If you're gonna get one of those over with, I'd probably go with VMars because it's the more difficult one, leaving you with a slightly less daunting pile for tomorrow.
