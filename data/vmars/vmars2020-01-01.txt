The Duncan scenes in vmars are SO CRINGEY!! He’s so boring omgShockata per essere a conoscenza di una stagione 4 di da recuperare tutta d'un fiato di cui non sapevo l'esisteza 🤣🤣🤣  Me too. I’ve had to remove VMars music from my playlist because so many remind me of LoVe moments.Vmars is stressing me outtttt“How would describe yourself?” Me-take Aubrey plaza’s character in and a compilation of every character and that’s pretty much it. (Mostly Vmars though) VMARS My beloved Christmas snickerdoodles were NOT the same this year. Had they not been expected/requested by family I would have skipped them.PERIOD IM MAKING MY MOM WATCH VMARS AND SHE LOVES IT He ruined Billie Eilish for me, who ALWAYS happens to be playing in those few seconds I'm waiting for my car to connect to my phone. Also, pizza. I definitely exaggerated the date because I made it when it first launched and that wasn’t until like...2006? Which was the end of the VMars saga. I was 17 😂 I couldn’t watch the rest of The Good Place and dont want to go to frozen 2the way that buffy and vmars are my favourite shows of all time and i got willow and veronica . yup yup yup The punisher, titanes y Vmarswhat i would DO to watch vmars for the first time again I’ve been put off good place and frozen. Can’t stand to look at KB. Final season of izombir was soured too Or The New Girl. Jessica and Rob Thomas (VMars) should get together considering they both have that deranged and misguided mentality 🙄🤦‍♀️ready for my shift to be over at 3 so I don’t have to be back until Wednesday and can just rewatch some vmarsAnyone else find it HORRIFYING and bizarre and crazy that Vinnie is annoying VMars, but the two of them were DOING IT on House of Lies?? i’m trying to bully my family into watching vmarsokay y’all, I have the majority of next week off so should I spend those days reading/rereading logan and veronica fanfics or rewatching seasons 1-2 of vmars + the movie? VMars fo sho. Also I don't know who Negan is but that has no bearing on my assessment 😁Another alumni! I guarantee you that Mercer killed the dot com genius in this episode of  Ohh proud of you now read some Vmars fics to reward yourself Well when u put it like that I’ll see you soon Facts What?? Does she really forbid VMars questions in interviews now?! Ya 1 saatten bir şey olmaz vmars izleyip hayatını karartmaktan iyidir fkfkf ne öyle vampir zombi mi olur flsnsns That's what I call a premature explosion! At least he waited until after they were married. Some guys don't.... So, sex with Logan is bad because they went married? They didn't get a chance after the wedding. Nobody - literally nobody - considers a monogamous relationship "single". I lived with my husband for years before we got married. At no point did I consider myself single - if I was, I too would sleep with other people "as a single". Just admit you were wrong. There's no shame. I'm so happy I'm not taking crazy pills. What a confusing answer to a genuine question! Guess we'll just have to watch and love all four seasons over and over again until KB is ready. We've waited before, we can wait again. NBD. I'm just happy to have four awesome seasons in my life! Makes this year extra special! She’d Probably treat him just poorly when she realized he was boring too. They won’t make more episodes because season 4 was crap. Too bad for you guys. That sounds awesome! And you’re splitting hairs. Not married = single Honestly that was probably my favorite part. I can never have enough VMars stuff. :) That is not the conversation and you know it. Stop being obtuse. You lost. Women can be sexually active to their content. The argument in THIS conversation is can she be a feminist and liberated and interesting while also married. The answer is yes. Yes, I can read. So I'll ask my question again: Who did Veronica Mars have sex with (show, movie or books) that she was not in a relationship with? Or "as a single" if you prefer. Rape doesn't count as consensual sex, FYI. As a single. Can you not read? All the time doesn’t mean with everyone. Jesus HC. is this vmars? ! I was late to the party BUT in time for the revival 😍 Love all of them. But VMars was the only show I watched 5 times in a row LOLSo many fandoms have been betrayed this year, got, star wars, marvel, vmars, the magicians, and probably more I’m not remembering at the moment. Let’s hope for better outcomes in 2020!!!!!!! shdjakdjajdfna whooooo? i want more vmars moots Oh sorry about that! You don’t know me so please do not try to sum me up in a tweet. I disliked S4 long before they killed Logan. I did not abandon Veronica. She abandoned me. With who, exactly? By my count, she slept with Piz, Duncan and Logan. Who did she have sex with "all the time"? Did you watch the show at all? Yup. Him and his wife, Blah Blah like to swarm all over Burn comments when they're bored. She's on one of the other offshoots of the original post, thoroughly beating upon straw man arguments. Wow! I didn’t even bother to see if was talking to a man or a woman. That’s even more egregious that he’s a man. Talk about toxic. I'm confused over how Quesa, a guy, thinks he can mansplain feminism to women. No matter how valid and thorough your argument, this crew is like the Fox News of fandom. They will twist everything around, gaslight us, and put us on the defensive. I suggest everyone block them. I should add that I actively dislike Meredith Grey, but love Grey’s Anatomy, so no, it’s not because I always want a happy ending. I want a good show with consistency. Nope. Not a hallmark fan. Why you so mad? Is it because you know you’re wrong? Agree. She did some pretty low things. Not only did she lose me, but she lost my respect as well. Not true. Breakup works. Staying single, etc. but to kill a character just so she can be a traveling detective free of encumbrance and to do it so clumsily, is the issue. They never should have married. She’s emotionally stunted and showed a stunning lack of compassion. I sincerely hope that correcting me a second time made your afternoon more pleasant and that you have a fun and interesting weekend whether on twitter or elsewhere. My feelings aren’t hurt if I use a paraphrase of that line every time for the rest of my days. They don’t write songs about the happy ones. The ones that come easy. Or the ones which are problematic. Which includes VM, now. Have a good weekend. Huh? She had sex all the time as a single. Your argument holds no water. Yeah you're right. I'll sit here, be quiet and take the abuse. Feminism! I’m confused. A woman can’t be a feminist and be married to a supportive man? She has to be single, bitter, and willing to sleep with anyone to be interesting? I mean, you came here in the first place because someone’s opinion didn’t match yours, so if anyone’s “jimmies” are rustled, I’d say it’s yours. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ And insinuating a woman is anti-feminist because they don’t agree with you on something? That just sets feminism back. Man, doesn't it suck when someone doesn't have the same opinion as the hive mind? Really rustles your jimmies, huh? I should just know my place, like all your favorite women. Yet...you’re here...on a thread directly against what you love. It was easier to imagine themselves competing with high school fuckup Logan. Adult Logan is hotter than they'll ever be, smarter than they'll ever be, has a better career, more emotional intelligence, and bikes for the environment. Their imaginations aren't THAT delusional. By “nameless group” I meant the group the OP was criticizing (a subset of male viewers). No individuals were named. The actual username shows up on every tweet, whether it’s about VM or not. Must be pretty exhausting to police all of those tweets... Vmars is amazing tho
