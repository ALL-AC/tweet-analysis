Logan and Veronica. LOGAN AND VERONICAAAAAAAA. Finally watching VMars S4 my Marshmallow hearttt. I’m so fucking mad I ever watched VMars just to be so disappointed Terminei Vmars, faltam dois dos pra terminar fleabag e tô vendo sucession. Agora o regis volta a falar comigo pois teremos assunto Seeing as you're a fellow VMars fan I know you'll enjoy Zombie. Loved the comics it's based on and love that Rob Thomas did a great job with it as he did Mars. vmars!! Piz only had proximity working for him. He is not damaged enough for VMars longterm. I would have put VMars with Weevil. Off of the first 3 seasons best BFs Teir List for VMars A Teir Leo B Teir Logan C Teir Piz, Duncan F Teir Troynancy drew started off with s1 vmars vibes and then swerved hard into spookytown dramaville They did a vmars one one time and I was like B*TCH!!!!!!! Yes!!!!!I don’t know what to do with a hard, disillusioned, Nancy Drew. It’s like is trying to be VMars, which is ironic since VMars was just a disillusioned Nancy Drew.My heart sinks every time I come across a vmars Logan line 😩💔🖤vmars movie timewhen I get home, which won’t be until like 3, imma watch the vmars movie 🥺🥺 Season 4 of VMars is really good. More coming, hopefully... I don’t blame you!!!! I’m not one to talk, I waited so many years for the new season of vmars and still have yet to watch it because of what I heard 😔 Our discussion of the VMars s4 finale was definitely one of the most negative ones we've ever had on . While we did try to highlight some things that we liked, we definitely dug into as many issues as we could in 2.5 hours or so. The backpack and lack of Fiji resolution definitely bothered me as well. I brought that up when we recorded our VMars s4 finale discussion episode. (If you're interested, it should drop Wednesday)when someone first starts vmars and slanders logan echolls I don't think I've been this excited for a comic con panel since VMars at SDCC in 2013. what the fuck they really decided to kill logan on vmars holy shitVMars anti-S4 twitter is vicious Imma have to save this gif for anything vmars relatedafter tomorrow, I’m having a mental health week from work...we gonna rewatch some vmars and cry Seriously though, finally finished S3 and watched the VMars Movie, about to dive into S4. I have to wonder how many times you'd have smashed faces at UPN/CW back in those days. You're a treasure, btw.I loaded a bunch of my bookmarked VMars fic to my kindle and didn’t load any of my bookmarked Alias fic, which of course is now all I want to read. Every single day I get angrier about season four. Only if youre planning on working out/balling later that day For me, Logan as a character has always been therapeutic. I discovered VMars at an extremely dark time in my life, and I couldn't put words or feelings into my own life, but I saw Logan as someone who was just a dark and destroyed by the world and I could relate and reflect (1/2) (also we're just hoping at this point that that was the series finale for VMars lmao)I really wish I could watch vmars again without the knowledge of Logan’s death. Things were so simple back then Some aspects of Veronica Mars don’t hold up with the passage of time...and there are some questionable narrative choices sometimes. But I loved VMars sass. Also...Logan. ❤️ I’m still a vmars stan .. just before s4while I’m here, I do not remotely understand the cultural fascination with Gilmore Girls, the original three seasons of VMars were fine but I don’t understand the hype and I was barely able to make it most of the way through the first season of BSG and never finished itIs Kristen still in Paris? I just want to talk about the train wreck that was VMars Season 4... Same. is watching “Dancing with the Stars” and I’m watching “Let the Right One In,” which pretty well sums up our entertainment differences. But we can always agree on and . Obviously, many of you have not read Rob’s older books (Rats Saw God, etc) which were written well before VMars. He does not write happy endings. No spite, ego, or desire for fame. IT IS JUST NOT HIS THING. Get over it.my fave character in season 4 of vmars was Guy Who Would've Been Played By Steve Buscemi If Steve Buscemi Were Hispanicomg just realized the guy who played shawn on bmw is the weirdo from the prison experiment on vmars s3 Vmars 1-4+movie, kingdom hearts, izombie, moonlight Those are the ones I can spot Wow. The final installment of VMars. So sad that season four thing didn't work out.
