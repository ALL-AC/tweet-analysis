 himym, vmars, new girl (well i’ve seen parts of it), tgp, friends, the office!! It always cracks me up when I rewatch VMars because, in my head, I assume they are each on different seasons. They also threw Naima off a cliff in that show. So there’s that.still trying to my find my dawson’s thread, my office thread, good girls thread, and vmars thread vmars so true of you You're welcome! (Or maybe that should be "I'm sorry." 😂) Same, though!!! Every time I see a VMars gifset I get sucked into the marshmallow rabbit hole again too asdfjk;asdflfinished beach read and i’m kind of obsessed with emily henry and her constant mentions of taylor and vmars Scratch SPN; I either mixed that up with her VMars appearance or Ash Vs Didn't she show up on Justified? I know she was on VMars and SPN How disgusting. Thank you for having the bravery to say something. I was, and still am, a huge fan of both Buffy and VMars. Without this, I would’ve continued to praise Wheldon, without knowing the damage he had caused. I hope you’ve found some peace, far, far away from him.maybe i'll convert to skam/druck/vmars for the next couple days till i feel like i can think abt btvs again without wanting to puke 🙂 vmars i will! i think i’ll watch it after vmars or idk, but i’m getting excited with everyone rewatching and live tweeting skdndnd have you seen vmars dax? :D never seen vmars i’ll get back to ubro I can't stop watching the last episode of vmars...... HELP ME!!1 how did I miss season 4 of VMars? 2 I just got spoiled thanks I hate it 3 do I keep living w s4 unknown or is anything of it worth it? awkward freaks n geeks dawson’s creek smallville the oc vmars fnlI choose to ignore the fact vmars joined the feds at one point. Also vmars is fictional, probably still corrupt tho. omg okay lina i’ll watch vmars 🙄a peruca da eleanor viva matando e esmurrando a peruca da vmars de 15 anos Lastly, thanks for showing me above. I hope we do get more VMars... I love how Kristen Bell made that character on the screen her own. I need to find something else to binge watch. The one thing that really narked me off too... In 8 episodes (S4)... She was attacked, shot at, threatened, it was like VMars had a death wish. I beg of R.T (Cause I love his other stuff too - OutCast.)... Just hold off writing something you will only go out destroy. Then to read he killed Logan off because he wants her to screw other people, drink like Jessica Jones, be a sarcastic foul mouth, taser using, with sex appeal P.I. Now VMars is a badass. But to destroy the integrity of the show characters that he suckered the fans into lovingYou're kidding me?! I'm a HAPPILY EVER AFTER kinda person. From ep1 to the movie then the last ep of which I just finished watching... To the writers of VMARS you had characters in a complicated relationship, then you end it like that.... like that one with Piper Perabo, which came out about that same time (Covert Affairs). I didn't mind Covert Affairs, though I probably would have liked it better with the characters from VMars. Still, the show wouldn't have had the same charm.I've always liked VMars, especially season 1. This is probably my 3rd or 4th viewing. I'm currently at the big climax of Season 1. I remember it pretty much blowing me away the first time I saw it. vmars = veronica mars sapphic = safica uauso betty took seriously about her vmars era and now she’s an fbi agent ??? I had logan vmars in mind but speak your truth degrassi stan ☝🏽 Only to watch s5 and see him cheat, like the only reason i can feel that emotional roller coaster was because vmars finally got my ship to be official official only to kill off my favorite part of the ship I remember 'Just Another' from the DC soundtrack vol 2, it felt like such a throwback when it appeared in VMars. It's also supposed to play over a certain dancing scene in 6x18 and again it's such a shame that they replaced it with something generic and meh 💔 verdade se quiser eu vejo com você terminei vmars so wheres the Bones movie 🤔 ive been watching DVD extras and in season 10 on the 200th episode you said you would be up for a movie 🤭or even a TV special like VMARS or Gilmore Girls.. OMG VMARSi finished vmars like 2 months before the revival premiered and i was soooo excited this will be my villain origin story legit had so much luck bc i started vmars the year the movie was released and then going through a revival announcement so many years later just to end up this disappointed.... still haven’t recovered it was traumatici was public enemy when i made like 20 oomfs watch vmars before revival and then it did THATmy mutuals who watched vmars freaking out when they found out about the revival, talking about leronica's wedding and new content. i felt so bad for them honestly your power. there is multiple medias i have never consumed (buffy, vmars, gb primarily) but i do associate with you just from seeing you on the tl Ooh i love it, its okay i still never really finished shameless. I was on s8 first round but then i started a rematch because I missed some details. S4 of VMars is a huge disappointment so just fair warning when you get to it, also big mouths newest season is WILD assistiu mais de vmars? i’ve just watched like the half of this is us, and i haven’t watched parks and rec, tvd and vmars i am!!! i think i’ll do a few short shows rn and then vmars and then this is us 😌 i also just haven't watched vmars and you are firmly in x-men friend bucket so it's my immediate association every time you say logan i think of logan wolverine EVEN WHEN the rest of the tweet is very clearly about vmars i cant even BEGIN to tell you how much of an inspiration you've been to me since i saw your dakota LoVe video (the video that got me to start vmars) - always in love with you wifey 💗 buffy, suits, dawsons creek vmars are on the watchlist vmars but it’s on my watchlist!!!shoplifted from the tl but how similar is our taste in shows 10% buffy 10% gilmore girls 10% that 70s show 10% new girl 10% atla 10% angel 10% doctor who 10% the office 10% vmars 10% parks rec VMars indeed! if the psych eps are too long the buffy and vmars ones will be too so i say parks rewatch
