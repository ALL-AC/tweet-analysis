Good call. Also, based on this tweet, VMars is now my plan for the rest of this evening (in which there is one more hour of awake). Thank you, üíØ, perfect choices made by all."I'm sorry, so like you're allergic to good acting?" Man, I'm not even there and I wanna punch him. Pull from your VMars days, Ryan. Punch first, talk later. "What can I say? The Mayor's a big VMars fan." Me too, Ryan. Me too. PS - it's my goal to get that trending by the end of this. üòâ ^^^^
