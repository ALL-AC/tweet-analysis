 Honestly couldn’t remember, I probably knew? Or he might have mentioned it? The thing was a lot of the ppl involved with CTS were crew for VMars / Rob Thomas shows. The dude I went out with was actually on VMars for a couple seasons, which we discussed on the actual date.Any fans ship Weevil Veronica ? W the exception of Wallace Eli always had her back We got a VMars Discord server if you want to get even less done.... I honestly think I won’t sleep tonight. Just gonna stare at the ceiling and think about how VMars has changed me You got a guy?That picture better not mean VMars is bringing back the wrong dead character. i think most reboots are trash BUT i am so excited for VMars that i legitimately become emotional when i think about itaka Daddy Kane from VMars I’m gonna play devils advocate for a bit. She was actually good in her guest role on VMars back in the day. But otherwise, yeah seems average on her other roles that I’ve seen Totally! It brings me so much joy that things like this are still happening in the VMars worldonce i finish this vmars ep it’ll be melissa’s birthday let’s goooo started from VMars, now we herei’m on episode 5 of vmars let’s get this bread!i'm going to finish the second ep of vmars, edit, and report back to y'alli’m tiredt... can’t wait to go home and continue vmars You’re watching VMARS AND YOU AINT TELL NOBODY???? Hope we can expect some VMars Interviews next summer. 😊 Would love to hear you talk to first episode of vmars was so soft and fierce i love it Test ran by don Guinella enterprises Are you excited for the vmars reboot on hulu??? No this is me. I mean, not VMars clips, and I don't need to edit, but I do procrastinate by cycling the same five or six clips, which of course YouTube recommends to me anyway If I come in on Monday dressed like VMars and a more cynical outlook on the world, you know what happened Ok No How about we launch all you lib mps into space.vMars exploration program would suit everyone of you. Trust me we would all be proud of you. One of if not the best qb of our generation... but i still dont fw buhl like thatTbh the only real VMars ship is Veronica/Mac. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Bob Kelly 😂👍amanda seyfried saying she doesn't want to be dead anymore under the vmars pic 🤧 re-watching yet again. I love her! Can’t wait for her story to continue. No one can play her but you.  It’s certainly not as good as VMars (nothing ever will be), but it’s quite fun too watch - and I love all the VM cast member cameos. I just downloaded the episode this morning. Will give it a listen tomorrow so that I can pile on 😊 (Also, I'd like to acknowledge the fact that VMars brought Ariana and Mitch officially into my life and I'm forever grateful.) Too bad I already follow you😂 but YAY for fellow VMars fans!!! ✨I’m out here following all the fans I can find.. like or retweet this if you post a lot of VMars please cause it’s sadly underrepresented on my timeline I still want a Terriers VMars crossover I am so with VMars on this one! as I am bingeing VMars right now! Love for Teen Wolf VMars 👏🏻👏🏻 two of our favs. Honestly we couldn’t narrow it down to 5 if we tried 🙈
