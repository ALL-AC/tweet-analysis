I have visceral Piz / VMars aversion to him. Did you knit on the VMars set? Oh and my other favourite VMars, when Aaron is beating up Trina's boyfriend to That's Amore. One of those many "there is something not right about Aaron Echolls" moments they drop Joan and her mom reading Adam's mom's note w Fiona Apple's Across the Universe cover playing on Joan of Arcadia 😭 Also on VMars when Lamb rescues Meg's sister and Run by Air is playing, so unsettling. U R A Fever by the Kills on Gossip Girl bc Georgina is about to fuck shit up I would be up for watching another. More VMars! Albums not good from first listen none of the songs had the wow factor everybody just de cuz its jcole Thank you bro!it's been 13 years and i'm still mad about the vmars s1 mystery.also. mac from vmars is in this episode. she's a peach and i love her. she's obviously going to die shortly.Catching up on izombie andand its tso full. Of guest stars, the girl from cxgf,badass synth from dark matter,the gang dealer from vmars (yes ive forgotten everyones names) when will we see a third installment book of VMars? We Marshmallows have been waiting anxiously!!  I got excited bc I saw vmars in your tweet but then :(
