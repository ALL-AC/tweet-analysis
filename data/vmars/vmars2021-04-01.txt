I am so freakin sad about that. :(i was gonna start degrassi tonight but the vmars ending really fucked me up😔Logan being snarky is the best part of VMars. I could just watch a reel of him from the beginning to end with his quips...The sheriff in VMars s4 played the original Renegade in IZombie. ... Rob Thomas Fam...Is mama Leone an IZombie reference in VMars??? Lol. Rob!!!!!Dax doing a cameo in the VMars movie! LolWatching the VMars movie drunk is just me Payseing the movie every time Logan Echolls is sexy. Goddamn I am hopeless...,no because i keep seeing that loganveronica from vmars arent endgame and it will be my biggest loss.Question: is there someone available to beta a VMars fic for me?I’m in the VMars movie again...I wonder what matchbox20’s Rob Thomas thinks of VMars’ Rob Thomas using their same name as a jab at himself in his shows. 😂i really wanted to finish vmars tonight but honestly the first episode of season 4 was so boring im just gonna watch himym now 💀omg i didnt even realize that keith and veronicas no cussing pact was just like the good place but in vmars it only cancels out fuck VMARS!!!Mercer from VMars is a reoccurring character on IZombie lmao VMars planning. I'm delighted for you!!I really love how VMars actors are in almost every episode of IZombie. I don’t know how I wasn’t retroactively led to VMars after I watched I Zombie the first time.i went to sleep late because i refused to fall asleep without finishing vmars and now i’m paying the pricethis does, of course, get more complicated when you move beyond the igw cast and consider the plaza/rudd/pr*tt parks overlap, the plaza/larson/evans scott pilgrim overlap, the thompson/half the known universe vmars overlap, etcwtf the movie wasnt even on hulu luckily i have hbo max which has it but that honestly doesnt even make sense bc they dont even have vmars on there literally and there were three in vmars i stopped in s2 vmarsi just realized i never mentioned how the professor from dc that had a thing with joey is on vmars as private detective i just saw him in vmars tooIZombie is like a VMars zombie au I like that Big Dick Casablancas from VMars played one of the parents... What a narrow typecasting that guy has as a hapless white collar criminalThere’s a Herst college in VMars and IZombie they are so in the same world! its true but its bc all the vmars stans disappeared after s4 😭Sac n pac’s exist in VMars and IZombie. We can effectively say they exist in the same world. Zombies just never made their way from Seattle to Neptune...Watching IZombie is full of wonderful VMars cast surprises.I am now watching VMars and IZombie at the same time. Chase Graves isn’t even in the story yet.I miss teen dramas like oth, the oc, roswell, vmars, dawsons creek, 90210 🥺😩 they just don’t make it anymoreand to me, the fourth season is the last one bc I refuse to watch VMars without Loganthis theme song is up there with vmars but not quite oth or the octhe cw is responsible for gilmore girls s7 and vmars getting cancelled meaning they caused the revival as well so they’re my enemies for life and now akiva is stumping hard for vmars! 💕 omg ive been kind of having a hard time getting through s3 of vmars it seems alot slower then the other two seasons ooh i still havn't finished vmars...i stopped mid s3 but ive been planning to go back to it for like a month, ill probably do it when i finish himym and smallville is high on my watchlist :))btvs: spuffy 🤲🤲🤲 the blueprint vmars: LoVe [though i still havent forgiven rob thomas] ‘reefer madness: the movie musical and vmars fame’ is sending meI’ll never stop loving the original “We Used To Be Friends” tittle song for VMars UR WATCHING VMARS?! So good wait hi add logan echolls from vmarsCan more people follow in footsteps and do a rewatch podcast?? Perhaps could do a VMars one?! Please!!!beaver from vmars being some like cool goth guy or something in jennifer’s body is so unsettling to me i hate that man i hate him so much I call it why-can’t-you-just-be-Vmars-syndrome jacey ryissa clois brucas leronica (clois third bc i haven’t finished smallville and leronica last bc i haven’t watched vmars)não acredito que teve vmars de 2004 a 2007 depois teve o filme em 2014 e em 2019 teve a s4 e ela não voltou mais pra mim te amo tanto veronica volta pra mim agora javajunkie is from gilmore girls and LoVe is from vmars 😁 ur valid and omg PLEASE stream vmars u will not regret jacey javajunkie brulian sethmer; haven’t seen vmars yet but will soon and i feel like they’ll beat sethmer interesting and LoVe is from vmars !!!!everything i do always comes back to them.. when i was watching gilmore girls i couldn't stop thinking about pacey and joey and all the parallels? even now with vmarsi genuinely hate what they did to the theme song in season three of vmarsaka charmed roswell nm vmars and 90210 yes i need to omg i meant to watch the vmars reboot season when it was released but heard bad things so chickened out of watching it 😭i feel so sorry for vmars stan can u imagine getting excited cause the show is getting a revival season only for your favorite couple to become death trope they are winning vmars is YALL BETTER WATCH VMARS ITS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE buffy vmars or ted lasso no but i love seeing you and like three other moots watching vmars, you are spreading the vmars agenda okay now that i’m here it’s technically i guess ur a marshmallow susebron. But like that only works out of the context of vmars yk. but within the context it’s nightblood saying vasher is a marshmallow. also this is funny cuz it makes vivenna logantava lendo sobre a trope bury your gays do nada tem isso em vmars que sacooooooooo e eu NAO NOTEI
