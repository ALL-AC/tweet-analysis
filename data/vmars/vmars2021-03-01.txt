trying to figure out how i can fit the rest of my vmars rewatch, a wandavision rewatch, a superstore rewatch and a wynonna earp rewatch into the next monthmichael cera on vmars is so wtf it’s one of the reasons i disliked the gg and vmars revivals too and why they felt distant from the original shows to me I live for all the versions of this song in the VMars universeLIGHTSONG WOULDVE LOVED VMARSso sorry to inform everyone that i have terrible taste and just as i always plod contently along thru non-LoVe parts of a vmars ep to get to the LoVe parts i’ve been doing the same with lightsong. wish i was normal really i do. i like the book a lotMore VMars than VMars“We used to be friends ripper” wow just like vmarsoh no i wanna rewatch vmars nowthey chose the worst fucking song for the outro of the first episode of s2 of vmars nowhere near as bad as vmars so you should be okay kdlasjfakl dkflajsdklfask god vmars set the bar way too low. honestly what i've learned is all revivals are evil and they kill fandoms. at least gg eventually came back but it was barren for years after the revival which is why i left 🥴. honestly though i think we got a pretty good deal if you compare it to like. the vmars revival so i’m not too mad about it anymore ela ta gostosona em vmars it’s on my list! i think i’ll watch it after smallville and vmars bc it sounds fun🏃🏻‍♀️ vmars, tww, scrubs, parks, gilmore girls, buffyI will say, for those who thought it was impossible for VMars to rehab Logan after how awful he started out as...how crazy that they even attempted it with Chuck? It's a lot to ask Ugh god there was so much shit in S4 I’ve blocked out! Lol I read Star Wars fanfic because I’m still too hurt to read VMars stuff Watched vmars for the first time in 2014, absolutely shocking the number of plot lines that are based on a character having different parentage than they thought. Pretty sure it happens to all of the main kids Creo q Vikings te puede gustar pero veo q muchos la han abandonado y puedo entenderlo. Stranger Things a mí me parece una joya, pero igual sé q no es para todo el mundo. Las dos primeras temps de VMars son JOYA, pero entiendo q junto con Dawson echen más para atrás por teens.rob thomas write a single plot of vmars that isn't entirely predicated on violence against women~OOMF REMINDED ME I HAVE THE VMARS MOVIEpeople saying they would watch vmars if logan and veronica were prettier bdhsbsj it’s truehow did vmars....make veronica........its worst character some people can explain it better than me but one thing that bugs me are the things she said abt the vmars revival concerning a major character death I DIDNT KNOW NO ONE WATCHES VMARSdoctor who relapse has passed we are entering vmars relapse u watching vmars and buffy at the same time is very sexyCHARISMA CARPENTER ON VMARS. LOOKS INTENSELY. vmars vmars hod tiu and himym are all must watches we haven’t forgiven you for vmarsrelapsing vmars phase and i’m about to make it everyone’s problemi will never forgive the vmars writers for how they sidelined wallace and weevil . vmars (the s3 ending when it was canceled) and there are a lot of problematic things abt that show but it was so interesting and good for the time, having conversations about race and class and sex crimes that no one else was having so openlyGod Damn VMars ending is gut wrenchingvmars is the worst show ever (every season they get a new milf and every season they kiII her)ALYSON HANNIGAN ON THIS EPISODE OF VMARS BARKSvmars soundtrack is so good. who ever was in charge of the music put they whole foot into thatkai você está bem não não estou a leila nunca terminou vmarsthe way vmars ended in a good way with a fan funded film that fixed the s3 horror show by reuniting LoVe ONLY to make a season to undo it ????????? whats the thought process i’ll never understand yeah definitely vmars season 4 and season 8 of that 70’s showwhat are some of the worst seasons of television you’ve ever seen? for me it’s season 5 of jtv, season 4 of vmars, and season 7 of gilmore girlsi feel like normally shows are better left without them like gg and vmarshow is logan echolls’ character growth the best part of vmarsi will never understand why vmars writers felt the need to make s4 when the movie ending was so perfecttransphobia on vmars 😁😁😁😁😁vmars really likes to use the weirdest possible lighting for flashbacks Long-term for VMars💕 the only show I remember watching while it aired was vmars but I’m contemplating a rewatch. I only saw fnl all the way through once because it hurt me a lot lol. I can’t believe I actually know some tv now!!! essa gostosa aparece em vmars que depressão nossa dinâmica = faz aí uma pack pra fechar o theme ok zland ou hg hg a pack em questão: vmarsi’d say “this is the last set i promise” buuut i’ll probably make some vmars ones while watching a movie tonight so
