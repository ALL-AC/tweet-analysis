 thank you so much for this omg!! i’ve been looking for a good vmars watch thread for so long 😻😸keith: what exactly did you do for that lady? vmars: feminist stuff. we got mad, we got even.... some scissoringwhen i first watched vmars i knew nothing about it and i was routing so much for leo and veronica imagine my surprise when LoVe kissed in 1x18 The hardest thing for me to reconcile is if VMars (the best show ever) is only the second best show Bell stars in.terminei a s3 de vmars adivinha quem vai ver madre solo hay dos eueu escolho ignorar o erro de todos que gosto em vmars eu juro eu não ligo que a mac lucrou com o teste de pureza eu não ligo que o weevil era líder de gangue eu não ligo que o duncan literalmente mandou matar o aaron eu não ligook antes de ver o 3x20 de vmars (que eh a finale da série original) vou te falar exatamente o que vai acontecer e quando eu terminar eu confirmo love vai voltar e vai ser meio enrolado ou vai ficar subentendido a v vai descobrir muita coisa sobre a sociedade lá talvez o+odeio todos os fãs de vmars que existem na terra e irei sim falar mal de todos pra semprevou terminar a s3 de vmars vou terminar a série das mães e ir ver o filme e a s4 e depois vou rever the good place e talvez depois eu veja true blood did you watch more of vmars They got a lot right at least. Angel, FNL, SPN, VMars, but I'm sorry Wild at Heart is NOT the most heartbreaking episode of Buffy. Yellow crayon?? YOUR SHIRT??? MOMMY???? Come ON.nossa amei muito a mensagem que vmars tá passando de um cara árabe falando que respeita a liberdade de expressão de um cara que literalmente escreveu terrorista diversas vezes no restaurante dele you GO veronica mars writing team i wanna watch vmars so bad i swear, but im dying for some romantic shit rn😭😭😭im the worst but what if i said i wanted to watch hart of dixie first instead of vmars🏃🏻‍♀️ what a weird pick for Buffy, imo. (though, going for The Obvious One would have been quite boring). But I just relived their VMars pick while scrolling through and I can confirm just thinking about that "moment" again, the soul crushage occured again. Also, Angel. Yes.meu pendrive quebrou do nada e tava com a s3 de vmars enquanto baixa de novo vou ver as duas mães la vamo ver juntas quando eu terminar vmarsi’m gonna rewatch vmars. it made me soo armie hammer em vmarsblaine is easily the best character in izombie so of course he is gonna end up dead coz thats what rob does to his best characters. NO I WILL NEVER FORGIVE WHAT HE DID TO LOGAN. he as good as took the whole vmars series away from me and i dont think i will ever get over that.i remember at uni i was talking to this boy and he sent me a picture on snap with leighton in that one ep of vmars in the background and that’s when i knew i liked him Would love to know your thoughts in the end. I could talk about vmars for TOO long vmars wtf jada 😕a charisma e a alyson em vmars so as buffyetes on HELPSBDHS i promise i’ll try to finish all american this week so i can start vmars soon😭😭enemies to lovers gay eh tão bom eu odeio vmars mais que tudo nessa.vidavmars eh uma desgraça vou continuar assistindoa carmen falando da paris hilton sendo que ela apareceu por uns 2 episódios de vmarsits wild to me that vmars aired right after ggi really need to make some new vmars editsever since vmars i always check the back seat of the car before i get in cos i'm still traumatised 😥 julia you should know better!!! also what is her job with the crows?? a vmars brisando muito achando que o duncan eh irmão delabisexuals do not fear vmars is here you haven’t watched vmars so you didn’t recognize him but i did. the oc has everyone! his character in vmars and as schmidt like...that man has RANGE yes, love me some VMars! vmars? vplanetmars? marsv? why don't i get it4:30 in the morning and im thinking abt mac's "ask me about my STD" shirt in that vmars episode i watched a few hours agothis is giving me very much the vmars cult episode HELPPPP my vmars phase finally paying off 3I started the OC this morning, already on ep 12, and this ep just opened with the vmars theme song. gave me whiplash i genuinely remember what he was wearing and everything... my brain knew i would be a vmars stan one daybest part of watching older teen dramas are the opening intros like yes vmars, the oc, oth give me something to sing along to LoVe is logan and veronica from vmars i think you'd rly like them so true and u should also watch vmars LoVe rly does serve yes jacey is from dawsons and LoVe is logan and veronica from vmars! literati = jacey ryissa burkhyde leronica cuz i haven’t watched vmars naley = literati ryissa benslie LoVe haven’t seen vmars yeti just finished vmars i feel so empty haley from oth, veronica from vmars and april from parks and recreading fic from the s1-s2 vmars hiatus lots of speculation about who is at the door the best answers have been meg or wallace did u watch s4 of vmarsdoes anyone know any vmars scenepacks (specifically logan/veronica)i hated elle so much on my first watch but now bc of vmars and kbell i cant hate her 💔💔💔🙄🙄🙄yooo reminder oomfs my priv is if u wanna follow (if i dont let u in its probably bc i am Very Strict abt the ages of ppl who follow me on there or bc like i feel as if i dont need 2 subject u 2 my vmars rants and stuff) its a fun timejust finished vmars and s4 simply doesn’t exist to me.. i can’t believe they did my boy logan like that IM IN TEARS If you propose a VMars panel at AAR I’ll submit to be on it. veronica (vmars) and summer roberts the way vmars wasted our time w him when veronica had LOGAN ???????? very confusing choicesI wish they had brought back Leighton Meester as Carrie Bishop in the vmars movie instead of recasting her Would have loved to see her as a wailing pop star with a dark secret i might watch psych before vmars but i think im watching the oc next 😁s3 of vmars was.. interesting s3 of vmars is literally so misogynistic like wtfi'm pretty sure i say this every time i watch this show so like once a year but vmars ahead of its time for trans narrative episodenot me debating if i should rewatch vmars seasons 1-3 + the movie even though it will make me more depressedoomfs who watch vmars what’s the best season in ur opinioni always think that your username is about the riverdale veronica and someone not the vmars veronica and logan help i like ur iconother than the one person I follow that has the kbell/vmars layout (I love ur layout asf) the rest of yall can go home deadass ... kick rocks frI rmr when it used to be like 10 active vmars stans that minded they business and was never tryna start stuff and bring up controversial shit about the show but almost every mf I’ve seen that’s started the show today always had something to say about it I promise you nobody askedvmars getting put on Hulu one of the worst things that ever happened to me you niggas are weird as hell and can’t ever just watch a show and not say some stupid shit if u gon act like this with vmars u can respectfully take yo ass to the good place period we don’t want yallEvery time I need a good romance, I rewatch the movie.
