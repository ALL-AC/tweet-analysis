what if i watched vmars to cheer myself up from the fact that i had a movie night planned with someone but he doesn‚Äôt care ü•¥ü•¥ omg vmars AH I MISS IT btvs vmars bmw and hod are all so good so any one of those ü•∞ü•∞It‚Äôs also the only episode of Buffy I‚Äôve seen. I had to thanks to a media studies class and hated it. We also watched an season 1 episode of Veronica Mars (the one where Veronica and Logan have secret makeouts in bathrooms) ‚Äî immediately went out and watched all of VMars. nicee, im gonna see if i watch it after finishing vmars, dc and breaking bad sjsjsjsthe amount of vmars on my tl thank you very much i approvewhy is pacey‚Äôs mother aka sue from glee in vmars they want me to collapse righti wanna watch vmars oh yeah, i read that she‚Äôs in 11 episodes, but vmars still intrigued me so im gonna watch after dc and bbalso forgot i started vmars i promise i wanna watch it i‚Äôm just busy and actually want to pay attention to it Very sound logic. My money is still on VMars but you know I'm incredibly biased. Agreed. Here's where I'm currently at: GG has big Back to School energy, but is also the most exhausting option of the bunch. FNL has the disastrous second season, but also Tim Riggins. And VMars is perhaps too dark for *These Unprecedented Times* but also the most hopeful? Frankly I can't even believe there are other options when VMars is on the table??? ÏÇ¨ÎûëÏûÖÎãàÎã§ Emily, at the rate I‚Äôm going bald, you‚Äôre not going to find many more hairs to split like this. Also, tweeted like someone who didn‚Äôt watch the Hulu season of VMars. PLEASE WATCH VMARS OMGno but im actually so sad and bitter and i wanna talk vmars with someone skskski didn‚Äôt watch vmars today, i‚Äôm felling empty insidecolin from jens body is an extra in vmars i love my life That's a good point. I spent an afternoon with some of VMARS at WPR a few years ago, having played with period kit before, and gave me newfound appreciation on an often overlooked piece of critical kit.if anyone makes vmars edits pls lmk i wanna love and support uthis is my 'please like and follow tweet if you've seen veronica mars' pls i want mutuals who love vmars and logan echollsyou think im joking but when i rewatch vmars next week instead of the shows noelle has given me you will seewatch me deal with this trauma by rewatching all of vmars and screencapping my by and just forever crying stream vmars on hulu and i looovveee blue bell homemade vanilla only Big VMars fan, have not heard of teenage bounty hunters, will check it out!also veronica not wanting to do therapy ,, mayhaps im more like s4!vmars afterallright back to vmars and my impending death üòäjust found out chris lowell is in vmars and it moved significantly up my watchlist Always room in my heart for more magical characters ‚ù§Ô∏è From VMars to Eleanor, they all mean so much to me!
