Today I burst into tears at the mere thought of Logan Echolls. It was quite unexpected. I’m still not over VMars Season 4 . idk if you’ve watched them but btvs, vmars, spinning out, wearp, stitchers, atypical, obListen. Moriarty is exactly what Cassidy Casablancas would have grown up to be like if he had lived past s2 of VMars.Watching new girl, 9yo walks into living room and hears talking about his bear claw and says “Eeeeewwwwww! What is Olaf doing?!” 😳😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 he also thinks Anna’s should stay because is cooler, lol!Hi, Writer Twitter! I'm a repped writer looking for my first staff job.

We're just a bunch of loving us some .descobri ainda que existe um xerife lamb na vida real e ele é tão filho da puta quanto o personagem de vmarstf do i rewatch..... i rewatched gg in winter, himym in winter, i rewatch htgawm eps regularly, i rewatched vmars last summer.... maybe chuck??? or dexter?? or teen wolf?hiii i’m looking for new moots who are a fan of: - kristen bell - dax shepard - vmars (LoVe!!!) - the good place - gilmore girls - jane the virgin - crazy rich asians - frozen like this tweet 👉👈 or pls spread it if we’re already moots vmars for extra pain Ooo ya do vmarsThe only problem now is that I’m entirely too sober to reread the VMars crossover fic entry in  WAIT U WATCH VMARS????a essência de VMars com certeza esta nos diálogos as sacadas extremamentes rápidas e o tom de ironia do Keith, V, e Logan dão o toque especial terceiro episódio todos os personagens novos e velhos reapresentados acho que agora começa a andar  vmars it is hm well buffy’s supernatural i don’t remember it being particularly funny (theres funny moments but its not hilarious), dawsons creek is a teen drama, vmars is also a teen drama but its also a mystery (theres an over-arching mystery and a mini mystery in every ep)e ver Patton Oswalt em VMars tem sido uma coisa maravilhosa. do jeito que ele ama tudo tenho certeza que ele era um grande Marshmallow quando a serie ia ao ar I had a dream about VMars last night. Maybe it was a sign to watch S4.the way i wanna rewatch vmars so bad but i gotta finish prison break for vmars?? it happened like a year ago + was all over Twitter + I was shit posting them for months lmao I’m just still completely betrayed and will never forgive DTM if they do the same thingpolitical opinions of vmars characters —i’m on the s1 finale of vmars and im just all over the place Hahaha yeah. It was already my fave color combo before VMars, and then they kept putting her in pink and green clothes all the time, I HAD TO. This reminds me of a loooot of VMars LJ icons you made 😍 DANA WATCH VMARS CHALLENGEwait is that logan from vmars??? when two worlds collideis this logan’s mom from vmarsremember when i thought jason d*hring was the best actor on vmars like not only the best actor I was really going around saying he was too good for the cw Oh no, even you, Susan! I'm sorry you have also experienced the hulk smash of S4 VMars.So I got my friend addicted to VMars and she just got to the end of S4 and is rage-texting me😬😬😬 I go to hell for this, right? For one more burnt marshmallow who watched the trash fire S4 finale?  Oh no! I am familiar with this feeling. I have had it for almost a whole year about Logan in VMars. vmars s4 literally gives me ptsd but i think ayitl is overhated honestlythere’s a planned parenthood poster in the back of this vmars episode,,, we love to see it
