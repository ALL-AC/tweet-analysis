 look if we’re being honest vmars is so much better than tvd 😂Had anyone watched VMars? Cause dont. Its shitty. A discounted Izombie. And Izombie is already a discounted show by season 3. And Vmars was trying to cramp a whole 4 seasons of Izombie in 1 season just changing it from zombies to vampires.the bgm is very vmars but this is nowhere near as engagingparece que tudo que eu vejo nesse últimos tempo a Kristen Bell ta no meio minha conclusão é: = tesouro americano VMars + Eleanor Shellstrop + BadMoms + TheBoss + Frozen If you haven’t seen Papi Chulo with Matt Bomer I recommend. Cheyenne Jackson I know from a brief Glee stint and as a RuPaul judge, but he’s a Broadway star. Max Greenfield (4) is on one of my fave comedies, The Neighborhood (and was in VMars). Wes Bentley , and scares me! is tgf as good as tgw though?? i was gonna start vmars until i saw the spoilers about the revival sksks also the newsroom is only there bc u mentioned it the other day 🤭 Matt Bomer Known for White Collar but this photo is all American Horror story , Cheyenne Jackson people prob know him from 30 rock, Finn Wittrock idk he was in Masters of sex, Max Greenfield I know him from VMars ;), and Wes Bentley idk what to say cause he is like way famous Hi I’ll be your VMars friend 💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️ I just finished for the first time like a month agoOf course buzzfeed spoils season 4 of vmars I voted Younger purely bc I think for me, it would be the best self-isolation binge (v light-hearted) and it’s still on, so you‘d be able to catch up!! but VMars is a close 2nd — a great binge definitely better if you want something with a v compelling mystery!!god the tension between the hosts in b*ffering is so awkward it makes me want to DIE especially hearing how different JOY is on the vmars podcast omggggggg i hate it like it’s sad but it’s mostly awkward 😭When Zita’s nemesis forces his way onto her tech contest team, she plays nice— until they plot to sell it to a corrupt DoJ. Determined to blackmail them, she delves into his family’s secrets… and uncovers her own. VMARS X THE CIRCLE  as do i.... A Vmars that wont break at the knee joints? Sign me Up I think we wont get anything about Mars unless these others sell. I want VMars too...I forgot baby Dwight was in this. Also this is a blast coming back to after finishing VMars. YOU ARE OUR LAST HOPE.rererererererewatching vmars and i'm on 2x17 and holy sh*t i always forget that the logan and veronica slow dancing scene is even better in the context of the episode/show i literally have tingles everYwhere Vmars But also VMars is the literal best and should always be rewatched. Eye candy or not. vmarsIt gives me great pleasure when watching tv or movies to point out actors and their link to VMars. Much to the annoyance of my daughter. Just now: Leah Thompson on The Goldbergs. “See her? “ Blank stare. “She’s in a movie with the actor who plays Logan Echolls!!!” Her eye roll. skip vmars it's a waste. I almost wanna say skip pose, but s1 is mostly excellent.buffy and veronica are often ppls fave of those shows (infact i’ve found it’s very fucking rare to find someone who prefers someone over veronica in vmars) along with peggy carter jessica jones Row 1 is a given, Row 2 - I was actually thinking about The Brady Bunch movie the other day and I've only seen VMars in Row 3 but still angry about season 4... Yes to Agent Carter and VMars!god i was wondering why i was running out of space in my mega and i just realized i have all of vmars s2 savedi am still mad about what happens at the end of season four of vmars but here i am binge watching the og seasons Well season 1 and 2 of VMars aka the good shit lol There’s Vmars vibes about them in a way- especially with the relationship she has with her dad. There’s also some Veronica Mars Easter eggs in them! You’ll love it!I really love how the random high school side characters in vmars show up in multiple episodes rather than just one, most shows don’t do that The day to announce that VMars is officially canceled. Real people have had real mental health issues from this miniseries - please spare them the thought that the cause of their pain will be rewarded. We, the fans, are looking forward to the day Rob Thomas must face the music. you didn't like the VMars reboot? the original was so good 🖤the way 2019 hate crimed me both with got and vmars.... vmars is the king of surprise before-they-were-really-famous cameo's and i love it
