sometimes i get this sudden urge to rewatch vmars but then i think of how hard it would be to rewatch logan scenes and i realize it's better if i don'tI haven’t seen Vmars season 4 but the only concerns I see are ship related so I might. Yes THIS!!! I was just thinking about this the other day, and how I don’t feel like I’m her fan anymore. It ended for me the moment I knew she signed off on Logan’s death.i just saw the news about vmars god i love vindicationI'm also frustrated that is always talking about how fans were mad that Veronica didn't want to get married and how "if there wasn't conflict there would be nothing to watch". Have you MET fans? I am 1000% down with V not wanting to get married and that fightWhat’s the deal with AO3 - it seems to be where all the best VMars fic lives, so obviously I need to get a better handle on it... Is there a way to set story/author alerts? ( is an account necessary for this?) When you least expect it VMars will be there to stab you right in the front because they couldn't get past the knife they already stuck in your back. They want you to see them coming. The best version of the show is one that honors the characters relationships it was built on. Season 4 chose to sacrifice, rather than honor, what WHO made the show great. I thought I would ALWAYS want more VMars, but S5 just wouldn’t be the show we’ve loved all these years. This is true in general, true about VMars here, even before you consider that with Veronica Mars fandom really is the core audience. has anyone made a vmars vid set to let's see how far we've come because that's about my mood in this exact momentwell done vmars hive we are sending this franchise back to the hell dimension it came from. none of that trauma porn fridging the love interest bullshit x That interview skipped the part where he said if you never see a Vmars season again he made the wrong choice and its his bad. Bye bye Rob. Awww baby vmars VMars gets honorable mention in my book as well -- it wasn't a comedy, but it was still funnier than most, and excellent as a drama! SAME. Occasionally, a VMars fic list will lead me there and I'll dip back in but otherwise I'm like oh thank god we're out of here I'm definitely gonna say "this is a terrible idea and Rob will only make things worse." But notice how he's exploring the option? Would an showrunner busy making another season of VMars even have time for that? Clearly he wants options 'cause he has burned so many bridges.should i rewatch vmars😚😚 That's how I feel about VMars lol This is one of those lightening in a bottle fandoms. I haven’t seen this since Xena, not even VMars fans could save that show for a 4th season. It’s really inspiring thanks for giving us love too!Y'all I read a VMars fic tonight and it was so wonderful and it took me back to the time before even the movie, but it also made me sad. I lived without the show before, I'll do it again, but I could at least be happy it existed before. Not it's a lot of sadness and anger. for gg there is the trip to harvard episode, the winter carnival, there are also some parallels between jacey and literati but i haven't gotten to them all yet so idrk and for vmars the only one i remember rn is pacey hanging out with a little kid but im sure there are morei have a feeling this ep will like the one where logan hung out with that kid in vmars and i really liked that one so we'll see! Yep praise everyone but rob. I bet he pulls out like KB did at the vMars fan event I have all of Smallville, VMars, and.. Psych, duh lol. Although, I'd love to have the complete digital collection Psych too.A few days of watching VMars and I am midway through the revival/season 4. I have very much switched in that I like Logan WAY more than Veronica and would almost like for them to break up bc she's dragging him down so bad.I have the next 2 days off work and I’m hoping to not have any panic attacks. I’m gonna go take a nap then watch some old vmars WHEN will Simone from The Good Place get her due? she was so baller in VMars and then they sidelined her. I need her to be the STAR of something. she's so clearly a STAR.Fosse eu pegando essa preguiça, ia ter um ataque de choro de emoção, tipo a VMars. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 What VMars guy? Wait the VMars guy has a podcast? Why?7/ But VMars’ overall politics were generally along those liberal-reformist lines — backing reconciliation between classes through goodwill, dissolving hierarchies rather than reversing them (or maintaining them). I'm still too pissed off at KB from her part in the whole VMars debacle so I haven't had the desire to even watch it. Knowing it's a shitty season makes me feel better I'm not watching it LOL i wish twitter had a better bookmarking system separate from likes, i havent watched the new vmars yet (and have remained unspoiled?!) but i want to read this when i get to it. we'll see if i remember!I ordered vmars, the office and the polar express ornaments for this year🥺 Um, pano kung di ko matanggap? HahHa. Like VMars. Haha. Medyo 15 years ko kinakatakutan endingI'm midway through VMars season two and does fandom darling, Logan Echolls ever stop being a massive creeper? Is this another case of fandom liking the most asshole white dude possible?everyone has been is this show i swear it's like vmars all over againnikki reminds me of jackie from vmars.....Who would have guessed that the VMars person who would come off the best after all this time would be the Scientologist 😂vmars mutuals can anyone rec me some good fics 🥴🥴AND NOW I CAN RATIONALLY HATE DUNCAN KANE. OH MY GOD FUCK THAT GUY true story: we adopted my dog around the time I first watched vmars, and my sister and I chose her name. her name’s lilli Yup! There are a lot of VMars characters who pop inLogan's an ass, but also I love his Inspirational message voicemails and wish I had the memory to keep a bit like that going I wanna reread the vmars novels, again....Listening to on Spotify and reading vmars fanfic. This is how Friday is going. There is room in the nerd canon for both Buffy and VMars! They are both very small.
