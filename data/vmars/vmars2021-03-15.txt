 CHUCK! that’s on my list and i’m very excited for it, i’ll probably watch it after charmed and vmars! im gonna watch charmed after smallville but i promise i’ll watch vmars after that for veronica and for LoVe Nancy Drew has VMars vibes and I totally LOVE it! vmars everyone please welcome to the stage dr. theodore kickdshins he’s here today to talk about vmars and transgenderisms specifically logan vmars before vmars? smhhey duncan from vmars the day the tl all watches vmars ill cryfor some reason that i do not understand i’ve also thought about rewatching vmars a couple times recently. and have to hold myself back for obvious reasons (frak u r thomas)when will a vmars renaissance take place we need more LoVe on the timeline i support this. if u were curuous theyre on here for logan/veronica from vmars and fitz/simmons from agents of shield respectively i love gilmore girls but i never finished it bc i just hated logan so much and i missed literati, i did finish tvd and buffy, some of my fav ships, and i'm in the middle of s3 vmars, i think i'm gonna start charmed or community they seem rly fun 😋 JSDJSK id like to say i’m going to finish it and this is just because i’m busy, but i did binge watch a whole season of the boys this weekend when i could’ve watched gg djdjdks truly i think it’s like vmars, i can’t watch it anymore because i know something will upset me 😭i keep switching back and forth from vmars to the space whenever the tl looks like something is happening 😭😭😭not even jason himself spoke badly about the finale and robs decision so they definitely had some sort of agreement. maybe kristen took it to far but her career literally started with vmars she had so much respect for rob and trusted him so her reaction is normalsmallville was very terrible i remember this channel in my country airing it between oth and vmars and it always made me so mad mfmffffm can you wait a little i wanna binge watch vmars first 😭 vmars first then maybe yeah 😼😼 The normal AM activity here is on 3615 which is the VMARS net frequency on the weekend. Good luck with the Hammarlund. The Johnson rigs are really rare here. I have never seen one in real life. Looking forward to hearing about the first contact.finished season 3 (the last season they didnt make anymore ever) of veronica mars so im going to start party down and later im watching the vmars movie I looooove VMars and just got my sister to finallly watch for the first time so got to relive it through her text reactions! We watched the movie together yesterday 😍 I have VMars going very far in my bracket. She's a top-notch sleuth!!! Highly recommend this show to anyone who hasn't seen it yet i stream vmars u stream t70s 😽 omg twinsies!! oh you're watching vmars rn? There was a good VMARS article on doing this. Keep meaning to have a go. omg can u watch vmars 😁 now stream vmarsalbie too maybe except i dont think ive forced albie to deal w my vmars bullshit all that much. but albie if ur seeing this i hope u also suffer re: logan and sawyer and me /romI only just found out that there are apparently VMars fans (maybe lots of them) who are like, super pissed about the big, life changing event at the end of season 4 Was there ever even going to BE a season 5? If so, who cares about the end? If so, I don't see this as a problem yes! It was after VMars but before Killjoys. 😂😂 that's Kristen tho. key phonetic differences. obviously VMars has the people's back Wendell is the whole love of my life he was in a vmars episode and I nearly cried !!! I really ended up liking daisy but I would never say fave... probably not even top five 😭idai que você eh o orgulho da sua família eu sou a única pessoa do stv que terminou vmarsthere’s literally only five ppl who watch vmars that are barchies😭this is making me want to rewatch vmars but I have to watch😐 I hear you! Personally I can’t remember much other than the ending, which is probably part of the problem with the season. VMars shouldn’t be forgettable. i literally just watched this show cause kristen is in two episodes out of the 20 😅😅😅 also ben wyatt!! but after vmars i just don’t trust this man Do you have objections to s4 of vmars other than the ending? valid u are one of few oomfs who knew me in my vmars days 😪 HOLD ON YOU’VE SEEN VMARS?? It just wouldn’t make sense w the amount of holes we have but they never do (heyheyhey monty my dear watch vmars) I mean I'm gonna play no matter what, but will be devastated if the trio of VMars, Columbo, and Jessica Fletcher don't duel in the semi-finals.I am doing a VMars rewatch and it's funny how much Leo in Season 4 resembles Schmidt in his mannerisms (vs previous seasons).sorry but if i edit i dont know lets say logan from vmars and use the veronica tag for views what is the problemdoes it make it better or worse if i was listening to my lilly kane playlist because yes i did put this song on one of my vmars character playlistsvmars: logan = veronica wallace weevil duncan = piss oh! I avoided the VMars episode because I've not yet caught up with the recent extra season. Good to know! :) (love this show by the way!) new amsterdam is so good!!! (Also please don’t watch vmars..... for your own health and sanity please)i think one reason jughead is so pathetic to me is cause vmars already did the biker gang x1000 better also, like, this is veronica piz in the vmars that exists in my mind. veronica can say the f slur she's trans and also i want her tolike who the fuck was actually sitting down to watch burn notice wtf. house was good the only thing i remember was hugh lauire being mean to the twink from dead poets vmars and pushing daisies are serves though!! FREAKS AND GEEKS = TARDE VMARS = MANHÃ RINGER = NOITE watch vmars if you haven’t rewatching the VMars movie with my wife while the rental is still good and I discovered... Veronica says her dad hid a camera in a trucker hat, foreshadowing that Logan used the "Free Hugs" to film the Sheriff admitting he's framing Logan 🤯
