Wallace smiling at Mandy tasing the shit out of Hans when her dog wasn't at the pound is pure gold. can you believe its been five years since the vmars movie Really it was one of the saddest days when I discovered that VMars was removed from Amazon Prime Also there have been so many great VMars cameos!! Every single one has been a true delight and I cannot learn any of their iZombie names 1. Are you fully caught up with iZombie 2. When you say Logan, I’m assuming you’re talking about the iZombie character played by the guy who was Logan in VMars 3. I feel like he could have chemistry with a lamp I was still taking gurly nmw just wanted to see what other ppl thought It's a busy month for the Veronica Mars cast. Francis Capra is going to read the books, support him promote the books! Ken Marino vid interview about Dog Days, also starring Ryan Hansen. Come on, spread the news! just found you gals and starting the VMars podcast! Can't wait! Then Firefly 😍😍 Also, Teddy Dunn was in A Walk to Remember? Was this a joke because he looks like Shane West?  You are really making me want to do a VMars rewatch 😩 Mmm that’s all I got Ugh did you eat some bread and soda? Did you try it really really cold? Good list. Definitely the right Downton EP and glad to see VMars on the list. I have an old VMars fanvid that is no longer on the web? Start housing tf out pedialyte Bought*** lol Work would help would have bout you breakfast. Shame lol On my annual VMars DVD-fest. Looks like you jumped from VM right into 'Like Father' -- are you EVER going to get older?? Team Duncan, BTWit's time I came clean. i got this phone well after vmars ended and long after my passion for the show had abated....but my keyboard consistently autocorrects love to LoVe and im pretty sure the sc*entologists have hacked my phone Just watched it had me bouncing off the walls Sounds top ass What you weirdo ? heya rob! can you try to get vmars on a streaming service? i'd love to rewatch but it's not streaming anywhere 😭 Adapt and move forward my vmars rewatch? yeah!!! just before i started dawson'sATTENTION Marshmallows!!!!! Seasons 1-3 are on sale on for /season!!!! This is not a drill! Calling all ! It's MINE! All mine! He thought I was his father Oh apparently they ended this a couple months ago... but would continue to sell the stuff already up, so if Graham kept his thing up he'd be one of the few raking the big bucks from the VMars fans Fair enough All my uber driver got is a shitty personality, I got jipped What kinda Fritos Barely bro😂😂😂 can you write English?? Veronica Mars is my happy show. No matter what I’m feeling if I watch some VMars I’m happy. If you ever need a production assistant or anything.... Fr I can maybe understand not being able to pick a specific VMars episode but their love of finales makes me think the S1 finale would be a pretty strong contender VMars surprised me. The way I mentally organize the 2000-2009 decade, my shorthand for the non-HBO dramas was The Shield, BSG, and VMars. Two no-shows and "Daybreak". I mean. OMG please please please do a VMars LT PLEASE
