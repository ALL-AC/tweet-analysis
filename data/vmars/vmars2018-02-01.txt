 oh if they ever touch VMars I will be so pissed. Lawd no. DC, OTH, VMars, Roswell, Charmed, O.C should be left alone. No reboot needed. Still hate them ruining BH90210 characters with the reboot. Wow... this is perfect for my Pitch/ VMars cover idea.... I've loved her since VMars but I do love the good place and all it's quirky weirdness. Love me some VMars 💕 hello I think torteen and fierce reads need to schedule a meeting, actual work totally business, definitely not a vmars fan club meeting, authors invited.How can anyone be ? He's a racist, classist, womanizing, liar, with abusive tendencies.  Gaurentee this man hav a tv they only like  Sorry about that but thought VMars would have been enough for you to watch. Also, did I need to move 16 hours away to better approximate your sleep schedule?! oh my god yess!! i can never find anyone who loves vmars!!! ahhhh Priorities brotha Your team just got beat by 31 points in the NFC chip.The rights reverted back to me, but it was a timely book (to the VMars movie) and also I wasn’t sure I was entirely proud of it, so I never published it myself anywhere. Just went on with my life.I was unpaid (I was gonna get backend on the sales) and they recruited me off a Bustle article I wrote about VMars.As far as I recall (and I’m a fallible person with flawed memory) the reason it didn’t get published was legality (I don’t think they...asked the VMars creators if I could write it) and also I THINK the whole vertical folded? Like I think they stopped making that type of book? also watching everwood gives you an ownership stake in chris pratt you can’t get from parks. it’s like kbell vmars. So it's not just me? Oh thank goddess. (Also, though I love Kristin Bell / VMars 4ever, Janet is the Muhammad Ali of the show right? Right?) Isn't it hilarity forever the ONLY ONE who managed to FIX stuff was the VMars movie? Everyone else ruined everything. massive vmars fan, just started can watch you in anything! Not usually a but just love your acting talent xo OK GENUINELY, THINGS I'M INTO BESIDES FOR STAR WARS: - funhaus - sp7 - sims - crazy ex gf - vmars - stranger things - fdtd - so many other shows just ask me - horror movies (scream is my Favourite) - books, sometimes - poly ships - witches - looking like morticia addams There’s a vmars fic somewhere where Piz does die. I support this list. Don’t forget VMars tho!!RL!VMars has basically been a disappointment for YEARS. thanks vince!!😊 watching VMars is always a good idea 😊 thanks cuz🖤✊🏼 Yea I did 😂
