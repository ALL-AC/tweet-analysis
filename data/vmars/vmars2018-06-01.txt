 Good look Vince dfsfdg ngl every teen detective.mystery show always pales to the first season of vmars like its tops It's been a very serious day. Looking forward to some downtime with my girl VMars.  VMars gives me life. ❤️❤️❤️ MOAR RICO on TV is always a good thing. even the ones where his char is dead 1x22 is just such a good season finale like ALL THE DAMN STARS  oh wow. I went to a VMars panel at SDCC but I don't remember people booing Teddy. What I remember from that panel was that the actors just passed every question they got along to Rob Thomas. "Oh, I dunno, Rob would really be better at answering that question..." Not a great panel He’s still a stalker, though. He always reminded me of Piz from VMars. Here is a “nice” guy, look at him be so “nice.”it's why i laugh pll fans dragging riverdale for similar plots. please. they're borrowing from 90s shows/films. pll in its early seasons was a bad vmars reboot and then it went totally off the rails but not in a good or original wayi forgot how much pll ripped off from vmars lmao they literally stole EVERYTHING YARK, thank you buddy ‼️this isn't abt veronica mars, but i will say vmars remains the Ideal as far as getting my dad to care to much abt garbage ships. we would literally go out to a nice sit down breakfast and shit talk all the characters and talk abt their stupid triangle in public. incredible.the filters this show uses for flashback scenes give me such a headache meg manning is an absolute angel + i love her so much :( veronica's face when she realises logan's dad has physically abused him has me feeling so damn sad :(((( pretty little liars tried so hard to be veronica mars but while vmars drags a teacher for fucking students, pll made it an "epic" love story. like.....yikesthe roof scene in the s2 finale never fails to make me cry  i already startedUm hello I meet tomorrow and I can't wait for my VMars lovin ass to DIE Boo, that’s terrible. Admittedly, I like Parker who I suppose fits that edict. But I’d rather have original team Vmars if given the choice. I def hope any further revival would have a center role for the VMars scooby team. Thanks young goat! Means allot ✊🏼💯 i’m trynna get some bubbly sangria can u answer my text pls what's going on? Why is not on anymore? Is it going to be available to stream elsewhere? What's happening. I've only seen it thru, like, 75 times now. Clearly, I still have need of continued access. count me in I donated 200 for one of the vmars packages and it wasn't even my favorite show imagine what I'd give for Lucifer i love logan echolls so much :( paris hilton in a baby pink tracksuit, peak 00s Feeling tense.... starting my VMars rewatch tonight when the crazies go to bed.  Like that was weird lolHaving a weird sunday so I’m watching vmars to feel better and argh i love this showSTILL MY FAV THEME SONG!!!!!! 💃🏼  trust no man in vmars like it’s a good show but there is so much rape Um actually the OC came first and VMars has weird overlaps with it. Re: my finale list.. In the initial tweet for this ep it said favorite or memorable finales. Buffy s5 and VMars s3 fall under memorable for me. The others were all def favorites ...gahhhhh when someone references VMars. 😩😩😩😩I love when they add vmars cast members to izombie Hahahha
