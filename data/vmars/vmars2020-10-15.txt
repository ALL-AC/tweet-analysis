i had such a great time watching lost/btvs/vmars and ill never get that with another show bye ill go cry nowim tired and just want to sleep so badly but lemme watch at least an episode of vmars thank u.... apart from bisexual veronica that’s my biggest vmars platform VMARS BECAUSE IM GONNA WATCH IT AND I NEED OOMFS TO SCREAM WITH ugh. i haven't watched izombie but vmars suffered reeeally badly from that exact thingokay vmars peaked my interest, im gonna put it on my listno i'm watching izombie and liv just said 'a long time ago, we used to be friends' and am screaming into the abyss i can't handle vmars referencesi want to start vmars but i’m already on s2 of angel and jj will k1ll me if i start another show before this is us...whole tl starting vmars guess that’s what i’m watching nextoomfs if you have a site where i can watch vmars hq quality with subtitles tell me but not a service because it’s not in the ones i have SO TRUE WATCH VMARS idk why u thought they would win😂😂 or cover that spreadprobably starting vmars tomorrow to fill my heart of somethingwait do i start vmars or superstore first??thinking about how buffy, vmars and the o.c are all set in california around the same time so they could technically all exist within the same universe hi! i’m doing okay overall:) watched an episode of vmars that made me very emotional but i’m good nowi need to scream about vmars series finale but i don’t think my vmars screaming buddy (theo) has finished it and i def don’t want to spoil it (don’t spoil in the replies) so i will just scream into the voidthinking of starting vmars bc the tl has been talking about it alot lately ajskq ok i’m adding vmars to my watch list rn i love the vmars content keep it up Serenity, Southpark, and VMars are the most seamless to meeveryone says gilmore girls is a fall show but so is s1 of vmars... i can’t explain itfriday night lights, buffy, vmars like it’s rlly just a walk it shame to shows that i got distracted from"We met and we talked and it was epic." 😴😴😴😴😴 Pretty sure that line was taken from vmars ugh I love the first seasons of vmarsi think imma watch vmars and call it a night we talking VMars now? Because that shit is *pure gold* and so is like everything Rob Thomas has made. Party Down forever, bro. its absolutely SICK. vmars s4 only exists until they get married in my opinion Right?!?!?!! It's so iconic. Thank you for bringing vmars to my tl.everyone on my tl talks about oth, the oc, gg, gilmore girls, dawson’s creek, but no one ever talks about vmars!have decided im going to start vmars after teen wolf ! everyone should watch vmarslol Allison is hiding sh*t in the vents like Lily Kane, so many vmars crossovers here  I believe I got it from my VMars fandom. Season 4 was a monumental fail almost all the way through.scrappy british vmars meets sheltered noble with a lot of flower knowledge just realized that they are my only happy-ending OTP left, after vmars happened last year Riz 🤝 Vmars Trans little detectives and Riz is soooo betrayed when she’s normal again... he’s like what happened to my emotional support detective that dresses like a muppet version of a human 😿 Oh man Riz is ABSOLUTELY like a loser abt databases and info access and has probably pirated so many paywall blocked articles and it drives him Crazy like... bro there is NO consolidation of info !!!He loves Vmars tho he def mourns her ugly little fashion when it’s no longer ugly Oh I love this. Idk much abt vmars but I think he’d find Veronica cool and be like kinda gay in love w/ her in that way of like gay men w/ Judy Garland yknow. ah yes for sure that makes so much sense, i love it 🥺also i’m thinking if it goes well i’d do vmars after and i think you love that show right? I started it when it started because between how much time I've spent watching VMars and how much time I've spent watching Cheers... duh. And I got too far behind for some reason and just stopped.
