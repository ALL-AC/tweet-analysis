I JUST FINISHED THE VMARS MOVIE IT IS MY DAY YOU GUYS If you can use VMars you can use Miss Fisher. You can do like Latina Miss Fisher or something.AND WEEVIL FROM VMARS1. I love when VMars alumni come out to play in 2. HOW IS THIS SHOW THIS AMAZING? Everything is ALWAYS 20/10 (And I'm still emotional because of tonight's episode... whyyyyy)Omg Francis capra!!!! alum Yeah give it a chance! Seriously, it's an underrated, clever, well written show. I'm biased probably because I've been a long time Vmars and Rob Thomas fan as you can tell from my icon. Lol. We need all the new viewers we can get. Thanks bro broJust had a dream that I met , legit dying because she is a national treasure. As I am talking to her about VMars, I get the nervous laughs and with come uncontrollable farting. Its 5am and I am now laughing and crying at the same time about ruining my dream meetingI just brought up vmars and now I guess t's real LoVe depression hours I think I related to Everwood the most? Or Freaks and Geeks. VMars is my fav though OH MY LORD. Veronica Mars is a snarky, bad-ass PI superhero. It's such a great show and it has the angsty fun bits of Riverdale mixed with noir detective mystery. A lot of VMars alum have been on iZombie. I def recc it.Shows taking shots at their network siblings isn’t really new (I think VMars did it a few times) but that recent scene on Roseanne actually did shock me, if only bc in context of ABC’s other behavior it really does look like they don’t have their other shows’ backs My VMars feelings could fill a book I need to finish VMars, I was so traumatized that it got cancelled that I never watched the last few episodes. Pretty sure it was the other one. He read an unproduced VMars script. Then closed with Smooth.
