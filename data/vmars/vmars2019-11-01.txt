 You horny horny 😂now i wanna watch the vmars movie I KNOW I KNOW I am just... enthusiastic about VMars. (which after S2 is I believe a vvery elaborate fanfic)"Got any enemies you know about?" "The klan" Wallace is the best Playing Pompeii at sporting events should be against the law. Now in my VMars feels all over again.When Zita’s nemesis forces his way onto her innovation team, she plays nice— until she unravels a cover-up his tech elite family would kill to protect. To expose the truth, she must risk everything: her app, her family, her BFF her life. VMARS X THE CIRCLE vmars 🤝 the magicians 🤝 mr robot killing off main characters bc they dont know what else to do w themI literally haven’t gotten out of bed today. I’ve watched vmars and started rereading another fic while also having halloween movies playing in the backgroundI have really bad cramps so it’s a stay at home and watch vmars day1x06 of vmars. I have nothing to say except I cry every timeI really cry over Logan’s cheeks and puka shell necklace every time I watch vmars huhI’m ready to be off work and watch vmars because i miss Logan and Veronica so much Damn yea roulette can be dangerous Them dice not treating you nice eh? I swear almost everything she posts online is an ad for something and it's exhausting! If I was a brand I wouldn't use her for that alone (and because she's a crap person) b cause it devalues your products if she whores herself around. Also Samsung is horrible anyway. okay, I'll def do this now! I too am a fan of ending consumption of media before it gets ruined for you (personally talking about VMars, SPN, etc) Also VMars “what the cuss!” If she is gearing up to retire from being number one on the call sheet than she’s just being a savvy business woman. I’m annoyed at Kristen, but I’m always proud of any actress making that money. Long term or new fans, like me.  Maybe don’t do so many paid sponsor deals and concentrate on delivering character performances that are actually the character not just playing yourself Or...maybe the person she was trying to please was Rob...the guy who jump started her career...the guy who created the show that gave her her first big break. I don't think she wanted this. I think she just didn't use her role as title character or Producer to overthrow him. I’m for it. Pretty sure it is, the outfit matches the VMARS Conan and her IG story same night that this pic is from. I remember because I hadn’t seen S4 yet and it was on of my last days as KB fan. How many likes can I give this tweet? Best VM tweet ever!Imagine creating a nacy drew show when she’s been recreated as vmars.¿Sabéis estas cosas de que te hacen prueba para ver si eres *el mayor fan* de algo? Yo pido turno para VMarsIt's been 96 days since VMars aired. Less than 1-in-6250 Hulu subscribers were watching it 2 weeks after it aired. It failed to beat even season 3 on iTunes or Amazon DVDs. It's Spanish premiere got "below-average" ratings. please make an announcement soon!  Damn it. You are like, 2-3 weeks ahead of me on the VMars schedule. Aww mate, that is some sound logic. For me Film-VMars is the end of canon. I was fully spoiled for s4 so just decided to not watch. Therefor I’d argue the lipstick finger gif is classic Veronica and not tainted (yes, I’m aware of the logistics hoops I’m jumping through) You're right I love the vmars movie aka the endingtoday was good until I got screamed at by customers for the store being out of what they want. I just need to go home and watch vmarsI would’ve said vmars, but season 4 exists so... For a pilot it was REALLY good. Had VMars vibes with a touch of super natural stuff, but not sure how hard they're going lean into that. Hopefully not a ton.on the 2nd ep, and this show is trying way too hard (and failing) to be a supernatural version of VMars  I’m sure we get fucking fire hosedMy life has changed so much in the last 3 months. I’ve literally moved across the country, made all new friends and started looking for a new job. My entire world has flipped upside down You know what hasn’t changed? My anger towards VMars and my undying love for Logan Echollsremember when we literally had our logan x veronica endgame via fan funded film and vmars decided to come back in 2019 and destroy our hopes and dreams and true LoVe. 🙃Okay so like Logan DIES IN SEASON 4 of VMARS?? What is Veronica w/o Logan? That’s like... Meredith w/o Derek. WHY DO THEY ALWAYS KILL THE TRUE LOVES??? I don’t even wanna finish the season 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃 you’re dead to me.Guys i think I’ve recovered from vmars what should i watch now I’m angry at myself because at first I thought this was legit - like she really said that, but then I was like “no she wouldn’t say that even if they are doing that” and THEN I finally realized it was a VMars reference and then my anger target shifted from me to Rob Thomas 😒thinking about how i watched all 3 seasons of vmars in like 480p Completely agree! This was in reference to KBell and Rob Thomas' comments about why they killed off Logan on VMars Season 4 finale. Ugh. The actual Vmars revival was bad enough without this too.I understand why people were so mad about VMars season 4 and I did not think it was great but counterpoint: Logan sucks and he’s always sucked ALSO I had to pull out the clear plastic bag we got at Hamilton because I need it for a concert and lolololol it has the VMars article inside itjust baked 4 loaves of bread for my family so now imma watch vmarsmy fav days are being able to get drunk af with maria and watch VMars and laugh our asses off 😂Hulu’s adding the vmars movie next month. h -I'm actually starting to think that Rob Thomas is never planning on addressing the VMars fandom ever again. Maybe he thinks that only talking about it in interviewers will allow him to pretend it was a victory. deciding if I should watch my fave vmars episodes during my weekend offI have this whole weekend off and that seriously hasn’t happened since I requested that Saturday off for vmars season 4 and it ended up being released a week early Stan (Aussie Hulu) was already promoting vmars s4 as s1 90% of the entertainment industry has memory holed every show from the WB and UPN besides Buffy and VMars and it's breathtaking how much majorly influential media they've erased. I appreciate you fighting the good fight on this one. You know, I feel kind of smug about Tessa Thompson cause I remember VMARS fandom HAAAAATING her and now she is mega famous and the actor who played Logan can't get a fucking commercial. Life is good! I know the news is filled with the impeachment inquiry but.... like... VMars tho
