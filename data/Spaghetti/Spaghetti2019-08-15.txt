I got some meatless options from Target with reasonable sodium content. Gonna do a vegan friendly/low carb spaghetti with meatless meatballs tonight. 🍝 I need to go to Publix to get fresh veggies and fruits. God, K-pop is unbearably grating on the ears. How the fuck can people listen to this bile?  I am a gamer. I agree that the culture has a poison permeating it. We are not going to free cultures of poison by attacking the cultures. Rather you are only going to end up uniting the good an bad elements of that culture to come to its defense.

I will never play a video game again therefore eradicating racism and sexism. Good job!

Coming from a furry, a culture all about pedophilia, zoophilia, and animal abuse. Video games aren't some kinda malevolent entity that needs to be vanquished. They're...literally just a form of media like music and film. Speaking as someone who's been the victim of a lot of bigotry that was stoked by the gaming community, getting rid of games as a whole... You've been owned and proved wrong for the last 24-hours, and yet you keep on going? You must be like that one person who keeps putting his or her hand down into the hot pot even though you burn your fingers over and over again. This is a brand-new level of mental gymnastics. No lie first Play through I use that perk o ate a whole squad but I ain’tplay with there corpses I just stole their shit and sold it for money If I found this open in a video editor on someone's computer I would call the police.

You have no chance.if spaghetti is plural is one single piece of spaghetti called a spaghettus I'm a gamer. I'm not afraid of black people, gay people, bi people, or trans people. All that matters to me is if someone is nice. I dislike Call of Duty and don't play GTA. Yet you think I want to shoot up a school and promote idelologies which I do not believe in. Ironic. September Rain was "nice". I didn't care for their cover of Live And Let Die. And don't even get me started on The Spaghetti Incident. This is why they call it spaghetti code So great work. You've essentially caused more issues than you've solved with this video. And the reason it's "blown up" is because people need to tell you how wrong you are. Clearly something has happened to you to have this hatred for gamers and you should probably get that- Where did you find the source of all of thing you said?...also, was short on lasagne sheets so some layers have been replaced by a sort of spaghetti lattice...fuck me courageously with the communist manifesto and call me the flying spaghetti monster Not to mention that the majority of gamers who are nothing like them call them out when ever they can (not to mention that they distance themselves from them as well). So, yes, it's 100% bs. Should we ban movies also?“ITS SPAGHETTI IN THERE” Such as depression, anxiety, bullying and various psychological disorders. Which have no where near the support they need in the US. People dont want to talk about their psychological issues because they fear they will be put under a blanket statement like you have done.- No. But. Sir James Eadie QC, the govts own counsel, has admitted in court that the ref was fraudulent, and if mandatory would have been voided.

Fredo is not (is not) a common nickname in Italy and doesn't (does not) mean anything. It's like the spaghetti with meatballs, or Alfredo sauce or Chicken Parmesan. Sorry those things do not exist in Italy You were clearly bullied in school. I am certain you deserved it. In a previous age you would have been hurt so bad you would have changed yourself and become successful. Unfortunately things changed and you will always be a soy filled ball of resentment and failure. So sad. Spaghetti Bolognese 😋😋😋Most Embarrassing Moment: wore a white shirt on a date and ordered spaghetti and spilled it on his shirt You're right there are gamers who do perpetuate racism and stereotypes, however, they are the exception (small %) not the rule and game companies do crack down on them when reported. Hoe don’t lie on me lmao, I don’t even like spaghetti that much But this wouldnt happen because we can't take away America's precious guns. Despite the fact that they cause more problems than they solve. So rather than blaming a group of people for racism, pedophilia and mass shootings. How about you look at the real reasons- And given its national persecution complex and is currently being used as a political justification for homophobia and racism, fuck their persecution complexSPAGHETTI NOODZMy spaghetti arms are tremblingjolly spaghetti😩 Once a country has attained all of the advantages failure to maintain its own Independence from countries it had advantages over is no one's fault but its own... Bitch you only heard me say I cooked spaghetti once or twice 😒 I'm going to steal this, but first i'll leave a like. Now it's true that some gamers have these ways about them. There's no denying that. But it isn't the majority. You're living in the past. Or how about we talk about the fact that not most but all mass shooters use guns. How about the US government bans guns so it doesn't happen?2人で幸せになって欲しい！ 陰ながら応援してます(○´ｰ`○) Damn....

We truly live in a society... I retweeted the comment. Just go to my profile to see it. dont attack them with logic theyre very simple mindedいつもいいねくれるの嬉しい！ 好き！ That is not a true statement. There exists good art that can make one comfortable, just as there can be bad art that makes one uncomfortable.My girlfriend thought I’d never be able to make a car out of spaghetti… You should’ve seen her face when I drove pasta! Actually, the reason homophobia and racism still exist in this world is because instead of focusing on respecting each other as individuals, folks want to identify by their demographics. Stop being what you are, focus on WHO you are. Baked spaghetti. Covered with melty mozzarella. They look amazing. I freeze them, cut in half, put on cookie sheet, let freeze solid, then put in a bag or container, and back in the freezer. Perfect to grab a handful for chili, stir fry, scrambled eggs, spaghetti, etc. Anything being cooked, they are a great addition. Riiiiiight. Classic blanket statement to make people look bad for online clout. I feel like I've seen this kind of misrepresentation of a community before back in 1938 but I could be wrong. How about we take a look at the good that gamers do like charity streams and the like-Had a dream my dog called me a stupid bitch after i dropped a plate of spaghetti on the floor.

Not specifically game communities. Most gamers want to escape what's going on in the real world when they play games. Your argument holds no weight against the entirety of this community. First of all The ESRB does not evaluate online interactions because that is out of the game's control A game cannot prohibit some kid from telling me to go fuck myself on DMs Also, please explain how m-rated games appear in toys stores(cont) people like you are the reason abortion should be legal Ey, what game you playing? Meal: spaghetti. Dessert: chocolate chip cookies. Not a good look. If you want to prove something, you should always be ready to prove it yourself with sources. Telling people to "just Google it" makes you look like you actually don't care about this "activism" (which frankly doesn't surprise me) Spaghetti A good step is to add chick peas or kidney beans to things. I put kidney beans in my spaghetti sauce. Also, chick peas go great in a nice chicken penne. Psst I think this one is satire Silly rabbit. Blue checkmarks are something you buy. You do realize that there's way more games than just those two oldies, and many promote goodness? Right now you're acting akin to a politician, and that's not good. Same man, everytime I finish a game I just go buy 15 slaves and make them work for me then I go kill 70 gays because I played a gamei am craving spaghetti, milk tea, donuts and possibly all the sugar in the world wewwszs De eso te das cuenta cuando no sabes ni hacer spaghetti If the people around it are holding a pint of beer, its Irish. If the people around it are holding a plate of spaghetti, its Italian. Diabolic spaghetti. What about the many studies that have been done that proves video games do not cause violence.

Many folks back then didn't think the poem was about "spaghetti snappers" like Cuccinelli. While there are problems in gaming culture, this feels like more a strawman type argument.

Sadly, they took the sad route; welcome to Twitter. Not everyone is out to promote their political agenda. At least not in an evil way. Nice meme, time to steal! Should the movie industry go to hell because it has abuse, constant drug problems/debates, and excessive violence and language? That sounds counter-productive. Asking for a gamer friend. tbh we can go into a long debate but this can be easily countered with the classic "the majority of everything you mentioned existed long before there was gaming". and change the word gaming and it can fit any narrative.

There's (cereal, spaghetti, frozen meals) in there. lol ...and its horrible. Ni idea tiene de cocinar y menos el plato de spaghetti frutto di mare. Tropezones di mare It’s still some spaghetti in there tho Here I was wondering what would be the most asinine thing I'd read today. Granted, there's still about six hours to midnight, but I feel safe calling it. I forgot about ravioli! That shit is good! But spaghetti o's and even the spaghetti with meatballs I never liked. Spaghetti with alphabet noodles ramps up my OCD and the noodle letters are broken so I can't make words and I throw it out. But ravioli IS great. I had spaghetti and meat balls and Dairy Queen cake for dessert I've had co-workers, male and female, who, going back to their desks from the cafeteria, bring their whole lunch into the bathroom with them.

Honestly I think all gmas do that. Mine put hot dogs in my spaghetti for my whole childhood and I’m just realizing it was weird. 😂 and to be honest I think the answer to that is no. They're not like this because of the games, but it's a medium to express themselves. Many people express their views/themselves and because of the bad it doesn't mean we should punish the good. This is the kind of quality headassery I expect from K-pop fans. "gamers vote republican" favorite part  How the hell did you go from the subject of gaming and K-POP to that matter?

They have to re-use memes from /pol/ such as this one, k-pop video overlaid with political commentary, I saw the first thread where it was introduced 👍😎👍 I think this has some points but gaming shouldn't be banned entirely, rather impose like some stricter rules on what games have in demographics. Games can be just as good as they can be bad. The question to be tackled here is if the culture will cease just cause games are banned this is by far the cringiest shit i've seen and most uninformed with zero backing.
