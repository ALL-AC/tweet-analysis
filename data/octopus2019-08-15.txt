Could always set the timer to 100% on octopus go. Understandable, octopus is a bit of an acquired taste with the look of it. How long is the car on charge? 4hrs does me fine. I like the cost certainty and have a couple of electricity hogs. アプリ？ps4？ Could be worth re-evaluating though with a longer range EV that could afford to skip a few nights... Not sure it would be worth the hassle though for likely minimal savings.

I'd think with charging almost every day that GO may be the best bet for now. But I believe you can flip between Go and Agile quiet easily once on Octopus. So you're not tied to a tariff. Other thought it also move other big ticket items to 12:30-04:30? Save more? Again I think you need to check your facts a little. Think of the National Grid as a river of electricity. If a new stream of electricity is Added by a company with 100% renewables, if you buy from them a part of that total power, you are still using 100% green as net (1/2) ちんちん ははははは。 Charge car at night 9/10.

Great episode Julia! Thanks for guest hosting bringing in fab, thoughtful guests. 1 thing: It's actually "octopuses" bc "octopus" is a word w/Greek orgin, not Latin origin. (Were it a Latin-originated word, *then* the plural wld be octopi. I learned this the hard way also 🦑.)oh my god my first day of volunteering at the aquarium was AMAZING!!!! i got to pet baby bat rays and feed leopard sharks and play with a giant pacific octopus!!!!! im so fucking happy i love all these fucking fish Nah, I think that’s just a mimic octopus. I am sorry but pretending ICE cars and EVs are the same is a pointless activity IMO, they are not. Part and parcel of EVs is checking chargers beforehand. Showing up at chargers that R clearly marked out of order on Apps, just hands anti-EVs free press does nothing to help EVsOctopus: *gun in each hand* Cat: You’re one short buddy Yep,...Tan books has a little book published a while ago called AA-1025(Anti-Apostle 1025) Freemasonry, secret societies, communism,Bolsheviks and Zionist Jewry is all the same Satanic evil bent on destroying Holy Mother Church, the Immaculate Bride of Christ. Octopus tentacles. We had the locations but that’s it. I’ve never checked to see if a petrol station is working, nor should you need to. This is what antiEV’ers always cite as a negative, so we took the negative away to play it their way. No point having a challenge that’s easy.I wonder what it is like to have an octopus tongue. うぽありです How much for the octopus plush and lolipop of halloween?Lotus trying to tell Junpei that the octopus has eight legs reminds me of Hinata not knowing how many sides an octagon has. ﾁｭﾜｰ!! やりましたのですわ！！(∩*´∀｀)∩How many tickles does it take to tickle an octopus?

So we're being home of phobic noir and trying to sabotage an octopus of color's opportunity here? 🤔 泉佐野市の天才アホ、バカ！ がんがる！ That’s just daft IMO. There are quite clearly differences in using ICE than an EV, and to not use Apps makes no sense. Besides, even an ICE driver will check to see if the petrol station is still open or locate it on google. 「oct」は「８」という意味です。タコはoctopus（8本足） オクターブはドレミ〜ラシの8つの音だからoctave。あれあれ⁉でもoctoberは10月、8なのに10だよ⁉実はむかしのヨーロッパでは3月が一年の始まりだったから、3月から数えて8番目の月がoctoberになったんですね（≧∇≦） 敏感になり過ぎ、もなにも普通相手が公人であれ私人であれ他人に対して、アホばか、は言いませんよ。いいかげんアホばか論争に終止符をお願いします。 พี่เป็นมา6เดือนอาการนี้ มันจะแย่ลง จนกว่าจะเจอมือใหม่Thanks to and for making me remind myself of the octopus scene from on the tram home.

Obviously you’ve never heard Yellow Submarine or Octopus's Garden, far shitter than any of them This octopus is my fucking spirit animal. Does the work well with the M3? Ordered one for my M3 to use on Go EV tariff Also, I’d add that EVs aren’t the problem: it’s the infrastructure. and are our best hope. It’ll all be so much better for EV drivers in a couple of years. Sadly that’s impossible right now for EV drivers: we have to have plans A, B and C. Obviously for some of us that’s part of the adventure but for most people that’s a real downside. Luckily for me, my wife loves driving an EV enough to put up with the hassle on a road trip.🦄🙈🌠 Shimmering Barbeque Sauce Octopus Shield ✨✨✨  ...So I think, perhaps I should... on the other hand, I just adore them so much.

By that time people will be talking about octopus and meat-free substitutes Press seems to say that Centrica is trying to shift more of its retail operation towards a business energy services offering; and Octopus etc betting there will be demand for tariffs linked to EVs etc. Much innov needed to get the non-active to enter smart new world.

My buddy who just learned about the dumbo octopus is going to LOVE this. Uhhh.  As the National Grid have pointed out EVs have the potential to store a lot of energy as part of a smart grid and give it back at peak times. I would suggest there is no incentive for National Grid to lie to a Parlimentary Enquiry. When I tried the raw octopus in Japan, to please my in-laws, I told them chewing gum was cheaper. I'm a horrible judge of seafood.  An octopus crime scene! I love it. And these people never say what they are expected to say do they ? Thank you. Thank. You. Sorry just spotted this. The premise of the vid was to do a very long journey with as much planning as an ICE driver (ie none). If that’s possible then antiEV’ers can’t use it as a negative. Checking the apps would be cheating. All in context. This assumes that they all charge at the same time. Which they don’t. The National Grid have already reported their finding to a Parlimentary EnquiryFun fact of the day: my 4 yr old sister played with a dead octopus at the beach for about 2 hours.

What‘s so special about coconut red curry... Octopus I eat here, that‘s fine :) The expense in this case is not due to the automatic part as it is in a petrol or diesel. The cost is in the batteries. These costs are falling over time. Running costs are much cheaper from about 1p per mile. Yeah but are they actually automatic cars? Some might say, an octopus’s garden 😂😂 All EVs are like an automatic. They are really easy to drive. You cannot stall them, there is instant torque so they feel nippy.
