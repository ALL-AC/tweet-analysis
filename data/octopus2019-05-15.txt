Nah en la temporada pasada era aún más poderosa y le hacía caso casi siempre a Tyrion. De nuevo, me banco la transformación. Pero la serie no convence nomás. Ojalá hubiesen tenido más capítulos para desarrollar a Daeneris. Sí sé que no son capaces de referirse a ninguno de los problemas del último capítulo porque se saben equivocados. No hay problema en que arranquen si no tienen nada qué decir. This is wrong. Horse is already plural 'cause it's got an 's' in it. All words with 's' in them are plural and to make them singular you remove the 's'. Horse - Hore Octopus - Octopo Stanislavsky - Tanilavky It's simple, really - It' imple, really. Glad to help. Voice recording. Works wonders. When I don’t have time to write it down, even if it’s just jot notes, it’s great to have the voice recording.

Eso hace más probable un final feliz clásico que nunca antes en la serie (justo la línea dramática que se supone critican)As for me… yakisoba or okonomiyaki, I wonder which one I should choose….. Ah, there’s fried octopus too! I can’t make up my mind–! Dat laatste komt omdat de savanne op het laatste moment uit de film is geschrapt. Verder denk ik eerder dat het is afgestemt op de Octopus en Panda, zodat die niet helemaal aangepast moesten worden, en de jungle is daar maar gewoon bij toegevoegd.“Octopus” is actually the plural. The singular form is “octopiss.” Done 😊 Me vienen a refutar y me dan en el punto. No has podido elaborar nada al respecto. 1) no es el problema por cual camino llevaron al personaje, sino que cómo: sin justificación y fuera de personaje. 2) El último capítulo setea un simplísimo bien vs mal, más Blancanieves q GOT. Me encantó que nunca más mostraron la cara de Danaerys. Era solo una fuerza incontrolable. Y a los que quedaron vivos también los aplastó.

Germany has a mutant baby 👶 octopus 🐙 with 4 legs👍🏻He's The Charming Fascist Who Is Seconds From Touching A Deadly Blue-Ring Octopus Muestra enésima de que se saben totalmente equivocados. En todo caso, lo que defienden es como que Julieta viera muerto a Romeo y dijera: "meh, si tampoco llevamos tanto tiempo" Se supone que debo creerme que alguien que casi siempre hizo caso a sus consejeros (al punto de perder batallas) y actuó más o menos sabiamente se volvió el villano loco por la muerte de Missandei y uno de sus dragones (en un capítulo)? Es bien distinto que actuar con convicción. Tremendo. Yo encontré demasiado bueno el capítulo. 그래야겠어요..! 광고 나오는데 넘 재밌어보여요 ㅋㅋ 固定ツイートのやり方が分からない (no le cuentes que Romeo y Julieta no es una historia de amor, sino una relación de 3 días entre un menor de 13 y otro de 17 que termina en un montón de muertes).nas hqs o miranha assumiu meio que o manto do homem de ferro mas nessa fase o doutor octopus tinha deixado tudo perfeito para o Peter mas ele conseguiu estragar tudo Todas esas acciones de violencia tuvieron su motivo y racionalidad propia. El cambio a violencia sin motivo es de los últimos cuatro capítulos Justo en la Cenicienta y Blancanieves hay malos simplemente malos, que es lo que estoy criticando. Pero hasta la reina mala tenía más motivaciones para envenenar a Blancanieves. Teóricamente ese arco es bacán. Pero el show no ejecuta, no convence del cambio radical. Si, en el pasado había tenido excesos; siempre había tensión entre responsabilidad y convicción. Pero sus acciones siempre fueron racionales. En cuatro capítulos se vuelve mala y loca. 저도 보고싶네여 ㅠㅠ 흑 시간만되면 갈텐데..! Me inventas expectativas que no tengo. Me inventas que quiero un final justo y feliz. Simplemente no puedes abordar el punto. Te sabes equivocado. Y eso q solo discutimos el error más patente, y no todo lo demás. 参加します Literalmente fue lo que dijiste. Evidentemente un mal argumento, que además, no aborda el punto. De tus opciones, In the court (la chamaquiza diciendo "ni es progresivo..."). Pero la obra suprema del Rock Progresivo es Gentle Giant "Octopus". Para verdaderos conocedores. Somos unos ñoños qls jjajajajjajaja Literalmente acabas de inventar que yo hice un estereotipo, cosa que no hice. Te sugiero no inventar cosas que uno no ha dicho solo porque no tienes razón sobre un mal capítulo de una serie que no entendiste. Es el mismo punto anterior, el problema es que apareció mágicamente en ese camino sin justificación y lo recorre totalmente fuera de línea con las acciones anteriores del personaje. どんだけ😂 こたさんワールドじゃん🌎 そんな名前なんか しかも、シラフでね。。 元島民の方々を前にしては言っちゃいかんでしょ。 参加します ポジショントークじゃないですかね？！杉本は特に市外選出ですしI hate the phrase mental toughness.

Te sugiero buscarte una serie que disfrutes, mejor. Pa qué sufrir. Una que entiendas, al menos. Octopus predicted some treble ちなみに推しキャラ誰ですか？(唐突ですみませんw) Obviamente, el guión no es malo por lo q acabas de inventar, sino q por lo argumenté antes y más. Y la construcción de personajes, a años luz. El Duende Verde, Octopus, sandman. Quién se acuerda de Lizardman? No podría ser más plano si se lo hubieran propuesto. Y MJ, pues mejor la MJ rubia o la hawaiana de ahora... Te puede gustar menos como actriz, pero se ve como MJ Simplemente observo que frente a argumentos, hay insultos, cosa común en quienes se saben equivocados. En ningún momento he argumento sobre un estereotipo, menos "mi" estereotipo, justo al revés. ありがとうございますm(_ _)m がんばります。 Por contrario, el personaje es mucho más complejo de lo que alcanzaste a cachar y, *pudiendo* ser una redentora, decantó por otro camino, sorpresivo pero cuyas bases estaban sólidamente instaladas con mucha antelación. I feel like we still won't know what the stage set-up is gonna be even after ticket sales LOL they'll throw up some generic end-stage concert pic and then two weeks later unveil some octopus-shaped crap so now row 18 is front row Una nueva muestra del problema: que te digan "ridículo" lo lees como una admisión de tu punto, descartando otras lecturas posibles, como que, en efecto, estés siendo un ridículo. Que el guión de la serie no se conforme a tu estereotipo de personaje no hace que el guión sea malo.hOY SUMAKAY KAMI NG OCTOPUS TAS TWO TURNS PA LANG NAIYAK NA AKO MYGAD.

Ridículo es que alguien argumente que el guión es bueno porque lo escribieron 20 personas. Pero vuestros intentos de insultar son buena muestra de que se saben equivocados. たしかに観光バスも多いですね。 Estás siendo ridículo. またもや外れた……おめでとうございます。 Más que argumentado porque tu posición es pésima. Que solo contestes malos intentos de insulto es muestra de lo mala que es. No hay ningún giro. Ojala hubiera habido un giro. No estoy reconociendo nada. Simplemente dije que el personaje se puede llevar en una dirección sin tirarlo a la basura. Pero obvio, si el guión lo escribió mucha gente es que debe ser bueno. Qué onda el argumento malo.

No he hecho ningún ataque personal, simplemente critiqué tu pésima posición. No te he dicho tarado, no seas mentiroso, si tu sientes eso porq no puedes contestar, es cosa tuya El problema es justamente ese. Ese mismo personaje podría haber sido un tirano sin tirarlo a la basura. Lo peor es que lleva justo a una disyuntiva básica de bien vs mal que podría terminar con el felices para siempre.i was studying making notes about fuckig octopus sperm or whatever and my mom comes into my room tweezers in her hand and shes like omg plz can you pluck this one hair out of my ear... no words Hell yeah!

Convertirla en supervillana de monitos es que no entendiste la serie. No era obvio porque Dany *pudo* ser la mejor versión de sí misma, pese a todo. Siempre nos mostraron lo mejor de ella también.

Think of the poor octopus, what could it have possibly done to deserve that fate 😮 The recurring theme seems to be that the individuals, groups, countries or ideologies being portrayed as the octopus are in most of the cartoons, clearly labelled using words, or national flags, or religious symbols. Not much room for misunderstanding. I used to dislike seafood (id eat shrimps only) until I became a true foodie. Try tasty seafood meals, like a true spanish seafood paella, Seafood Kritharoto (Greek specialty), grilled (not fried) calamari/octopus in Italian or Mediterranean restaurant)My favorite word that my son says is “opotous”. It’s his cute attempt of saying “octopus“. 🥰 The image itself isn't anti-semitic, I don't think, but considering the history of the octopus in political imagery (which you laid out well) artists are best to just avoid it altogether. I'm shocked, but not surprised, that Emily is part octopus! (And I'm shocked, but not surprised, that I can be shocked and surprised at the same time. Is this also a sign that I too am part teddy bear and part octopus? I'd better find help quick!)

Only difference will be, you would be choosing the losing team 😂😂😂😂 I always think of Frank Norris 1901 novel The Octopus about the power of the railroads in California No octopus imagery. Too tainted. Eli Valley's subversion of old antisemitic tropes in his critiques of the far right are allowed, but as an exception that proves the rule. Lots of other ways to show how much the Koch brothers suck In that 1938 Nazi cartoon it's Churchill who is the octopus (long a common trope in anti-British Empire propaganda) and the Star of David is throw on almost as an afterthought, literally piggy-backing on an older trope. Earliest example of it that I know of.I tag 💜💜💜 also i recommend mini pig or raw octopus eating asmr or if ur feeling extra spicy loli asmr One thought I had is that I didn't know the octopus thing had been used in anti-Semitic imagery and you also took the trouble to tell us so probably you thought many others might not know. If the creator of the image knew, then it's Antisemitic, and if they didn't it surely isn'tworse than the earth dying from pollution is the feeling when you’re listening to a playlist and a Tide ad comes on. the same plastic, Tide detergent bottle that will eventual become home to an octopus, and slowly deteriorate for millions of years to come.

Thats an afwull amount ot octopus dicks Octopus and squid as a “hands in everything/everywhere” motif has been used in anti-Semitic ways but I wouldn’t say it’s anti-Semitic itself. I’ve seen it used for US military patches and anti-mafia protest signs to give two examples. it’s definitely anti-octopusFor Mother’s Day, 7 chose an octopus bundt pan. Cephalopod cake for days!
