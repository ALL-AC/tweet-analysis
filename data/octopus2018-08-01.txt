I don’t see a problem with supporting a streamer or anything at all, but I can’t defend supporting someone as dishonest, greedy and disgusting as someone like Phil. I think it’s about time he gave up and got a job, he can’t afford that house. He should stop trying to. こちらこそ記憶が甦って楽しいです！ What is the difference? He was a politician, only difference is the political system the country was practicing then.Octopus kalami7:35am: Black Moth Super Rainbow The Octopus Project—Runite Castles—The House Of Apples Eyeballs I one shoukd support a guy that is this bad of a person. Honestly, I’m surprised he’s never been arrested. 風船ガムのCMソングでした♪ On a real note, if I actually did watch Phil as a fan, I’d be so fucking bored of him constantly going on about money non stop. It’s pretty funny that that’s all he talks about, but yet he has no idea on how to manage it.An octopus' testicles are located in his head. As a military ruller not as a politician. Difference is Netflix doesn't scam you or be crying about not having money for taxes while flying someone they hardly know to Washington guess you better give him that stupid pity money soon when "something" else happens as always. You will be better off using that money on your little ones compared to giving that same money to a growing big man like Phil who makes around ,400 a month. Just saying. I mean. Yes. And they don’t sit on camera. Dood. I need that money. Forget about my side job. I need that money. At least Netflix is worth paying for and is entertaining I mean it’s proven he’s a home wrecker, a liar and a scammer. But you know he’s worth the money. Keep up the support. You are absolutely right you can do what you want with your money. I just want to point out that Netflix does not beg for 1-1.5 hours before starting any movie or TV show or threaten to take away content if it doesn't get X amount of subscribers. He was there in 83 Your comparing Phil to Netflix. Lol. Ok. Hey real. It’s almost like you enjoy being scammed Octopus have 3 hearts and copper-rich blood 🐙 School him DM sent :) thanks!
