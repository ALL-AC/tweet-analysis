(Es mí opinión) Hacer mucho deporte entre semana y comer mal un día del fin de semana. ALL OF THE BULBASAURS!!! i love that Ryan Reynolds is now my Danny Devito understudy Es que esa imagen es un sedentario que come mal!!! ( y baila fatal todo sea dicho) Shizuka's battle plan seems sound. Similar to Battle of Hattin, I think. But will it work vs Octopus King?

I just can't believe this is the Deadpool sequel we didn't ask for??? And Mr. Mime is going to murder me in a ditch????? Ya dentro de las dos cosas extremas, si haces mucho deporte y comes mal te arriesgas a lesiones, oxidación y sedentario a tener el culo como un plancha y sin mucularura pero vivir hyper relajado y feliz y eso se nota y mucho Well, they have had talking bears, cats, dogs, gorillas, dinosaurs, ducks, plumbers, strange creatures from space sea, sea gilled land walking creatures, octopus, squid, spiders and little furry things that you mustn't add water to , so . . .

Entiendo que vives acosado detrás de esa pedazo cuenta... no me extraña😅 Mojate y opina😋 Puff que difícil, habría que definir que es comer mal y cuánto es mucho deporte. Ni lo conocía..., era una pregunta sin trampa, solamente saber opiniones y el por qué de ellas. I had the octopus and the lobster dish. I can’t spell it lol. But amazing Si lo he entendido del tirón,ya no es minimizar el impacto calórico de la comida chatarra con deporte intenso...es la repercusión de esta sostenida en el tiempo lo que me echaría para atrás.... Si comes super sano y no te mueves y si comes muy mal y lo gastas? Nicki left it? Ahí ya depende de más factores, no solo de la alimentación y el ejercicio: genética, sueño, entorno, trabajo, etc. Que elijo el comodín del público 😅 Nivel hormonal ? Comer mal, lo que ahora se le llama comida basura y hacer deporte intenso. Es difícil, el sedentarismo mata, pero es que la comida cada vez es más insana y actualmente eso pesa mucho. Ya van saliendo los estudios que relacionan a los ultraprocesados directamente con enfermedades como el cáncer, así que me decanto por comer sano. Demasiado fácil, creo que tendremos que mirar más que pasa en el organismo, a nivel de hormonas y demás... yo igual...aunque complicado elegir...jeje Creo que me quedo con la segunda.【タコ足配線】octopus wiring 用例 "Fantastic octopus wiring!"
