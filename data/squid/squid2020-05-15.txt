My comment is a response in disagreement to a previous one saying the director is saying his movie is a point on "good poor, bad rich". You sure as heck did. That was a good night. I'm surprised you didn't have to drag me out of there feet first. When these methods work well, the resulting plot makes me think of an ancient sea creature. Mostly streamlined like a squid, with a few menacing arms at the edge. 🦑 I don't think I have it anymore but basically I own a rainbow squid hatThe Squid Sisters and Off the Hook have great music! Oh- Dedf1sh too! *:3 She’s being made an escape goat over this. Suspect nothing’ll happen in the end. Be a real damp squid. 🥺🥺🥺Hhhhhhhhuuuuuuuu....Brruuuu....sniff I love these dirty squids so much...Nasty toothy trash man...garbage stink boy 🐙 Oh! Ostrich steak! Kangaroo steak! Crocodile... bits? (Not the best) Shark fin soup (I was 12 and nobody told me it was a bad thing and I was endangering the planet) Chicken Hearts are AMAZING! Any kind of Octopus or Squid? I believe I've had chicken feet too. Krang's Revenge? snorting soda for my sins 🥺 Portraying rich people as relatable and a product of a system of oppression and exploitation doesn't make those rich people NOT the villain or at least their actions NOT villainous. Sure there's subtlety in his portrayal but the end conclusion is not an endorsement of rich peopleSquid Squad - Seaskape (Nicaragua Creole English Localisation) Excellent. I have come across a real-life damp squid while proofreading. Obviously that's an oversimplification, especially for Parasite, but you seriously telling me Snowpiercer has any subtlety in just pointing at shitty rich people and going "get a load of this guy" Which I'm 100% here for, just sayingmy god i just had the best squid party in fucking years, i feel ELATED thank you Armatron and woomy THAT KATTDr. Overcoat sent yeh? Can't keep them robo-squid-arms outta me quarters, can he now? Har! There is a kind of small squid that lives in shallow coastal waters. They are clever, lively and adorably cute. I forgot the species unfortunately :) 今日の旦那ガチャはひかりのタクトでしたSquids should've been in a cylindrical tank, tbhKung ang fishball ay gawa sa fish at ang squidball ay gawa sa squid, Saan gawa ang kikiam?Are squids not claustrophobicThis verse Squid sent me ain’t even fair😈 Took me 26 years to get hip lol 900 de ping todo el dia la compañia Octopus or Squidhi u eat squids Just sold all my ODX this morn!

The smell of it cooking is horrendous and I can’t forget it. A science class dissected one and the teacher cooked it after. The whole wing smelled awful for days. I remember that post, it was Tumblr I think but I saw it on PinterestThings prepped ready to print: -- smaller flan -- smaller macaroon -- larger ice cream -- larger scaled wave -- angry cactus with 5" usable length -- octo-squid It's probably going to take me a week to get all these done :P It was unusual for the massive armoured squid to need to do this, but he did it anyway. First, he lifted his gas mask up and reached his arms around her to pull her in close, and then with a quick "Here it comes" as a warning, that's when he pressed his lips gently against hers Ok - joke version first... is that the sick squid I lent you? Ok. Serious version - don’t be freaked out. Just try to find where it may have come from and plug the hole... The line is Hans who does dishes is as soft as Jervais, for mild green hairy lipped squid.johnny joestar defense squid I'm a fucking squid now,and if you can't respect that,you can go fuck off. Gervais is the chef, Hans is the Dishwasher and neither can bring themselves to kill the green squid with a moustache. "For Hans that does dishes is as soft as Gervais with mild green hairy lip squid".🎶Hands that do dishes can feel soft as your face with mild green hairy lipped squid🎶 The intensive noun squid invents by wrangling its bottom. 頭の回転が面白いこと言うようにできるてるね笑 Tnx po 😊 The squids are discussing you with Cthulhu right now!

You seem to be a fan of bullying tho so shush Bullying 21 رمضان I think it’s usually kids who don’t do research and just jump to conclusions... They can, but it's pretty obvious the point he's making here by saying "greedy, malicious villain" is that it refer as someone bad. It's the commentary of Bong Joon-Ho on the movie, I invite anyone to go watch it, he talk more on the point of the whole "rich against poor ". 1時間くらい誰も来なかったからやめた Thanks Squid❤️ It's a must have for Thai food, which I haven't cooked for a while as I have run out of Fish Sauce and always forget it. a man in a restaurant asks for the squid. It looks like it's got a hairy lip. Its aggressive. The big german dish washer man is brought in to catch it. But he is scared. Hence the punch line.. "hans that do dishes is as soft as your face with wild green hairy lip squid" My squid boi♡♡♡ I was going to fish a big squid, but I caught a cute one.🦑🥺💦 I want to go fishing again when the COVID-19 converges.😷 Thanks‼︎ But,The camera has good performance📸🤫😂❤️wwwwwww EPCOTIA(右上)のショッピングバックは反射素材でとても反射するため地元で歩くのは恥ずかしいです。 The best thing they could've done with this is to limit it to one gear item like they do with ninja squid, otherwise you get people stacking 3 of them on clash blasters or splattershot prosthis time it includes my love for tea and squid x'D This is what people mean by "using Etika as a shield to deflect criticism"...

No squids until we've gently introduced them. It was supposed to launch alongside the game but they delayed it because "it wasn't up to the usual fallout standards".

You brought up Delta Episode and RR despite them stating the opposite of what you said. Hell yea we goin Barnacles rn we just waiting for king squid to drop barnacles this year I’m guessing all over the county.

I won't because your awesome!!!! Definitely an idea😂 Delta Episode only states that ORAS and RSE are different worlds, therefore not a source. RR having RSE design is irrelevant as those two are taken from worlds explicitly not from the games. You should make a video were you join random people's party xD XD 3 This was perfection If it were squid ink you could at least use it on pasta. LMAO you're not the only one :'DI hope made some spaghetti today! 0w0 You have finally come through and told us to buy the DLC to our favorite game. Thank you kind sir. You have been forgiven. Optimization is a playstyle. People like to do more than 10 damage per hit. You didn't find it fun, but other people enjoy the game more when they can kill something in under 10 minutes, and not 30 minutes. Clutch Claw makes this drastically more annoying. 👀👀👀 np^^!

Шоб пешком ходить ) я вон и до Петроградки отсюда пешком ходила, когда у Светы жила :)) Но для начала лучше бы просто работу, конечно :( It's also common sense to actually read the game's dialog and not rely on forumspeak as a source. Love you squid man Justin I appreciate your enthusiasm about this but I’m waiting until we know more not everything is known at the moment I’m not defending abuse of employees I’m just not aquatinted with the situation enough and I feel more will come soon!

It's a split. no this one😭 The thing with the eggs though is the hunt for them, dealing with cryptic clues and nonesense. But that is for the minority. The size of the megaladon does wow the uninitiated... It's just a fact you don't need a source. If every copy of every game is not different then everyone would have the exact same team because they aren't in different universes. Just accept the canon if these games That version difference wasnt given an in game explanation. Ok...did I ask?Breaded Items are on the move!

Add another to the list. All been pretty lame since BF4Now Playing Squid - Sludge  I'm trying to edit a video for jacksfilms and I suck at editing videos in any piece of software lol. As a way to explain version differences, yeah, it was bw. сильно далеко не хочется. Сюда классно приезжать в гости. BF1's eggs tho Confirmed divisions: 1 black and white 2 oras and rse 3 suns and moons Everything else is indifferent to differences. Did I ask? In all seriousness, what’d they do lmao. They’re leftists like us is that the only response your 3 brain cells allow you come up with? We all know Schiff is a squid. Still, it wasn't a concept introduced in BW. Multiple worlds was pretty much the big takeaway for everybody else, anyway. Luv u 2 squid 💚 That theory has been debunked multiple times. Delta episode was an extra post game plotline in oras about saving hoenn from an impending meteor. Multiple worlds were a plot point, not "the point". Maybe her lips then?

Happy birthday, thank you for sharing/retweeting a lot Squid Sisters content, I send you all my love ❤️💚 Each different game is in an AU. Especially ORAS because it confirmed AU's/timelines exist in the Pokemon canon. So yeah ORAS is in an AU Source? やってないよ〜一緒やろ〜💓💓 It's hard to follow Mr Gum, for sure.

Marie, ready to fight: request denied //I like to think that the Squid Sisters are really protective of one another ORAS is not an AU. because mega gallade was new at the time.

I would have never noticed thatYou messed with the wrong kid, squid face! The gameplay of MHW Iceborne is terrible because of the clutch claw. The skill weakness exploit, which is a staple skill, is based around the claw. Claw also determines how much damage monsters take from us. Without the clutch claw tenderize monsters take less damage. If you don't know what you're talking about. Maybe don't talk about it. Thanks dude Their fingers end in short, sharp, triangular nails ideal for picking kelp (and fighting off underwater predators). They are graceful in the water, but their modified feet make them slow, clumsy walkers. They are sometimes derisively called squids by unmodified humans. I think Giant Squid plays here also! 🦑 I’ve mentioned sirens before so I’ll talk squilens this time. They’re probably closer to what people think of when they think mermaids except they have lower halves more similar to squid, octopus, lobsters and crabs. Upper half can vary in how “humanoid” it looks. I too enjoy missing out on a large portion of damage that the game locked behind tenderizing while gimping hitzones to accommodate the new "optional" feature, and the Claggers that I can 100% ignore except I can't because they're baked in. And Weakness Exploit that was nerfed. Oh A giant squid on roller blades! Large entities force greater levels of efficiencies as well. We see that in fisheries like squid. What is entirely reasonable (imo) is to limit the number of crew rights by listed entities or those with XX Rand TURNOVERS so as to ensure max access by medium to small businesses. Bloody hell 😂 I’d have told the neighbour you’d have an easier time trying to shove a giant squid in a suitcase Squid Baron, Blobfish, Ammo Baron, Heart Squid let's goooooooo Love squid!

Definetily not made to draw views. SwSh DOA: There was no sign of the game flopping, and the title is clearly made to instigate hate on the games That's not how models work.

Squid - SludgeMy fear of open water has to have stemmed from Zelda: The Wind Waker fuck those random whirlpools and giant squids False advertisement "SWSH DEAD ON ARRIVAL" "MODELS ARE REUSED" "POKEMON FALSE FLAG CONSPIRACY" Attract attention/Entice users -Sonia in a swimsuit -Giant red letters, circles, and arrows Deceptive, sensationalized, misleading None of said videos titles are true.

The definition of clickbait. Is that... Loss? Wait...you actually believe he put that title because he believed the games wouldn't sell well, and not because he knew people would watch a video called "OMG SWSH WILL FLOP GAME BAD GF BAD"?It really annoys me that a group of squids isn't called a squad Sea Lord (implying he is commander of the ocean), or Kraken (implying you're a big squid)?
