YOU LOSE THE WAR! after the war the admins added a temporary npc to the skyblock hub: the potato king. it gavr out a new talisman, which boosted potato minions by 5%, a basket for the top 1000 potato farmers and to me:towards the very end, squid had one of his goons write a program to chart how much i was farming by tracking how much experience my elephant pet had, but by then it was too late. once i won the war there was nothing left to do except celebrate my victory with grace and humility.and squid couldn't realise the real number when he got a level 100 rabbit of his own, because he was being sabotaged! but the biggest reason my lead expanded by that much was because over those two weeks while squid averaged 8 hours of farming per day, i averaged ELEVENhow did i do it? its just as sun tzu says. "all war is deception." you see, i knew after the second potato war video that things were gonna get more difficult from here in out. because at this point squid had a full organisation backing him. he had goons, a cabal of billionaires makasih dear😭🥰 ak udh difollow sma semua yg dimanaged sm .kamutuh, askrl sm subaskrl, squid dan subsquid, beautythings, collegefess, ombb(lg lock), animalfess, sma msh ada lg tpi aku lupa wkwk klo mau nitip jg monggo🥰😌and after sacrificing two weeks of my life, i finally reached 500 million potatos.

You asked the question. Would it be too much to ask for a middle difficulty on the Squid Beats game? For most songs, Normal is too easy, and Hard is too hard. The Salmon Run songs are especially bad about this.goons betrayed me and gave him one of our internal documents. and the list of backup pet users is literally right there at the top of the first page, i have no idea how he missed it! but anyways, squid logged off an hour and a half ago, he should be entering rem sleep just aboutbut squid was also farming several hours a day, and he had even found a way to maximise his afk coverage. he started sleeping with his headphones on and had his goons wake him up via discord call whenever his alt left his island.

I understand now that it is only with a worthy rival that one can reach their fullest potential. While he may have lost the war, he’s gone from 70 subscribers to having 10’s of thousands of fans. So it can’t be said that he’s lost completely.I guess my main regret is that I bribed Squid’s discord admin to give my alt permission to see into his secret text channels and then he never used them all year. With the war over, Squid took down his potato minions and my fields have gone unfarmed. While we were enemies,-with grace and humility. OH MY GOSH. He’s doing a little emote on me. Oh my, NOT LIKE THIS. Was this necessary? WATCH ME DANCE SQUID KID U LOSE! U LOSE THE WAR. After the war, the admins added a temporary npc to the skyblock hub. たいよろ Make Giant Squid a year round thing! ❤️ Thanks again guys for bringing it back. Even just for 4 days! Until next year! isaw,, kwek kwek,, chicken ball,, squid ball 俳優の栄信さんをお願いしてもいいですか···！ Did I say I stayed home you squid? Reread my original tweet I LOVE HER I LOVE HER I LOVE HER as far I know Hell its just a place or at least a minor curseanother level. Towards the very end, Squid had one of his goons try to program how much I was farming by tracking how much experience my elephant pet had. But by then, it was too late. Once I won the war, there was nothing left to do except celebrate my victory-squid averaged 8 hours of farming per day, I averaged 11!! I just can’t believe how much he’s farming.The admins were legit saying that techno’s just like, so focused, it baffled them at just how insane he was. He had no breaks. I swear to god this technoblade dude is focused onI don’t know, it’s probably bugged. And Squid couldn’t realize the real number when he got a level 100 rabbit of his own because he was being sabotaged. But the biggest reason my lead expanded by that much was because over those two weeks whileIt’s just as Sun Tzu says, “All war is deception.” You see I knew after the second potato war video that things are gonna get more difficult from here on out. Because at this point, Squid had a full organization backing him. He had goons,Squid was shocked. He’s at 499?? No he’s not. Dude th- thats actually not possible. Noooooo. It’s not.. this can’t be real. I don’t know how far behind I am, 100% less than 30 million. And yet when I won the war, I had a lead of over 88 million potatoes. How did I do it?backup pet users is literally right there at the top of the first page. I have no idea how he missed it. But anyways Squid logged off an hour and a half ago, he should be entering rem sleep just about now. It would be a real shame if someone woke him. I didn’t actually wake himAnd I was like, Can I really tell him that I can’t get his medicine because I'm farming potatoes? Can I really… Look, I’m an atheist but when God sends me to hell, I want him to hesitate. Ok? I want him to hesitate for a few seconds. But Squid was also farming several hoursYeah, squid could farm that in a couple days. Squid starts putting in crazy hours. If I do 12 hours a day, can he keep up? Absolutely not. People say technoblade never dies, but I'm putting him in the grave. Meanwhile I'm sitting here in Shambles.inventory so you don’t have to spend time on that. You know, two minor changes which just so happen to buff Squid’s farming method from 200 thousands potatoes to 1.2 million. And my farming method becomes worthless. Suddenly my 45 million potato lead goes from insurmountable toI mean I’ve been tracking Squid’s potato count. I counted for his afking coverage by having the discord bot track his alt account log ins And I knew how much he farmed by hand because I was monitoring his farming experience. With a 45 million potato lead and a farming methodbut just has a 130% faster way to do it... You’re probably wrong. At this time I expanded my lead by another 5 million potatoes but at this point Squid and I had been farming potatoes for almost a year and we were still farming hours every day with no end in sight. Neither of useven after subtracting the amount of minions would’ve made themselves could get 410 thousand potatoes per hour. For the next three weeks Squid farmed hours everyday. But I was farming at the same time. What are the odds he’s farming rn. 5 bits, I bet techno’s doing the same thingthey don’t need to waste an upgrade slot on a super compactor. So I spent another 250 million coins to get 48 total fly catchers. Squid and I both started farming potatoes but his method could get at most 200 thousand potatoes per hour whereas my method with double fly catchersIt’s all fun and games until the squid hat comes on"The Squid Sisters have the song called the City of Color. But not all of the cities are full of hue! I have seen the upper shirt of the Koreas and its lack of hue makes my brain feel the sad and bored..."I guess the squid sisters are ok. 爆笑www 声出せないので必死な引き笑いになった（笑）"I don't know why people find Adam Driver good-looking. His face looks like a squid, his body looks like a fridge." -Aisya, 2020 im quite squid at the moment 新しい芽が出てくるかも？？ Tried posting my myday na kanta but it changed when I posted sa twitter.. Uhm.. ang creepy.. めっちゃ鳴くじゃんwwwback. So ⅔’s of the time spent farming potatoes is replanting the potatoes you just harvested. Squid Kid and his viewers spent many hours trying to find a work around to this. Even building an elaborate redstone machine in an attempt to somewhat automate replanting.highest level could increase crop yield by 25%. Ordinarily a buff to manual farming would be bad for me since it allows Squid to catch up that much more quickly. But I had a plan. The reason farming potatoes by hand is so inefficient is when you break potatoes, they don’t growbut he only saw the surface level of what I was doing. You see I wasn’t just leveling up my farming skill, I was also leveling up multiple legendary rabbits. There was a reason I wanted to stop people from afking on Squid’s island even after he started afking himself. And it’sI don’t even wanna tell you how long it took to build this. And so I began farming day after day. At times i’d farm for so long without a break that the people watching thought I was botting. Word of my pumpkin farming soon reached squid. Who began farming pumpkins himselfwhy are you so mean to Squid. They don’t understand this is war! There is no holding back. I know that. And Squid knows that. The only difference is that i’m 20 steps ahead. He’s playing skyblock while I’m playing Death Note. He thinks he can out-smart me with my own strategyguess what I found a few hours later. A brand new skyblock account afking with a level 1 legendary rabbit. Truthfully, I could’ve stopped Squid before he even joined my island but I wanted to catch him in the act because i’m always getting comments saying Omg Technobladeinto his hoppers for weeks. But he sent that tweet 8 minutes after he kicked my alt. So I get to thinking ‘Why would Squid lie about that?’ And I realize Squid knows that I monitor his tweets. But what he doesn’t know is that that was my alt account. From his perspective,worst thing someone can do to you in skyblock. Now I’ve always been interested in psychology. In fact, I almost majored in it. So after 6 months of stalking squid kid, I developed a bit of a psychological profile of this man. I know how he talks, I know how he thinks.because someone filled his potion system with rookie axes. A common trolling method is to fill people’s inventories with useless items like boats. But the rookie axe is even worse for players like Squid Kid who use the skyblock add-ons mod which has a feature that makes it very 装飾品とか安物の時計だけやわw帽子やネックレスとかシルバーリングとかハイレベルすぎん？ というか頭でかいから帽子が壊滅的に似合わないよ！ Windtalkers or Squids...Native American War Heros or Spineless Sea-Creatures- During the squid festival, Makoto complimented Chigusa and Gou for their looks, - それだと減台も仕方ないw コロナよりディスクアップで閉店に追い込まれちゃうwww 服装なんて自由でいいのです！ （夏はアロハ冬はパーカーしか着ない男より） The decision to go with octopus over squid my first time through on the first line was STRESSFUL. You got this beautiful ❤️❤️the only way to stop this from happening would be to get Squid to close his own island to visitors. Without him realising that that's what I wanted all along. It took four long months but it finally happened. But anyways, back to this tweet. So Squid says he closed his islandthat doesn’t hurt him anymore. And they’d be like “IM HELPING!!” And afk all night. Squid Kid was getting boosted by my own viewers and there was nothing I could do to stop them. Cus what was I gonna do? Announce that afking helped him? Then more people would afk. I realised thatsquid’s island every night. You know, as a joke. Sometimes I would be on Squid’s island on an alt account and i’d see someone say in the chat “I’m gonna go afk to help Technoblade win the potato war!” And i’d beg them no dude please. Please, they fixed that months ago,Now it was easy to get people to afk on my island. What was difficult was getting people off of Squid’s island. You see even months after the first potato war video came out when the initial hype was starting to die down a bit. There would at least be one of my viewers afk onAnd there was only one thing boosting my minions by 10%: the farm crystal. The farm crystal’s an external buff, so it’s not included in the offline calculations. So if there’s at least one person on my island and squid’s island is empty, I’d get 10% more potatoes!“Wait! Come back! NOOO!” So Squid closed his island which meant I couldn’t sabotage him anymore but what if i told you that was also part of my master plan. You ever notice how my island has been open to visitors during the potato war? In the last video I explained…guesting limits but unfortunately on march 20th my alt was kicked and Squid’s island was closed forever. The jig was up. But by that point I had already achieved my objective. The two weeks it took him to realize what was going on, cost him about 2 million potatoes.But my problems didn’t stop there you see squid got an alt account to afk with his rabbit pet on his island while he was doing other things and since the alt account had no reason to ever leave his island it became much harder to keep control of that priority.But unfortunately an unknown third party got there first and sold his level 100 legendary rabbit directly to squid. Of course he didn’t forget to brag about this victory on stream. Oh my oh my, you know who doesn’t have a level 100 pet?of course I did. But unfortunately, complications soon arose. Squid and I had both been rushing to get our rabbits to level 100. I had a pretty heavy lead and I figured it’d take squid several weeks to get his there.But every night around 2 am, Squid would leave his account afk and go to bed. And that's when I'd strike. Overriding his rabbit pet boost for the rest of the night. And yes, I memorized Squid’s sleeping schedule to pull this off, I mean at this point how is that even a questionIn fact, it usually had the rabbit pet deactivated throughout the day since you don’t need to have the pet out to keep priority. And since the rabbit was deactivated if squid checked his minions during the day, he’d find nothing wrong with them.I waited for the day I released the second potato war video to start. After that video, tourists flocked to Squid Kids island to see it for themselves. My alt blended right in. Everyday my alt would sit there in Squid Kid’s afk pool but maintain rabbit priority.Slapped a level 1 legendary rabbit pet to it and shipped it off to Squid Kid’s afk pool. I knew I had to maintain absolute secrecy. I didn’t even tell my goons about this. Cus I knew once squid got wind of this it would be trivially easy for him to prevent it.They wouldn’t get their rabbits 30% boost. They’d get the level 1’s 0.3%. Unrelated fun fact: Did you know that squid kid’s island is still open to visitors. Yeah, that's right. We’re doing this again. So I bought a new minecraft account.But the third thing I found was the most interesting, and this is what Squid Kid didn’t know. If there's multiple rabbit pets on the same island, which one boosts the minions. You’d think it’d be the strongest one, but it’s not. Haha, McMonday That’s fine but still lmaoooooI was pretty discouraged but literally a few days later I came across an excerpt from a Tarantino interview in which he talked about how he always enjoyed going to theater alone.

In the anime, Ash's Pikachu is g-max capableI'll likely be out hunting vampire (squid), (a lot is at stake), so lmk if you need something. 대환장ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ진짜 하시면 저도 하나씩 주세요 책장에 꽂아놓을래요(.?????)ㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ클라렌 제로 늑대 셋이 같이 짝짜꿍 환생하게 해주세요 시비 털러가겠습니다(왜다시태어난애들한테시비야)arent squids a type of octopus? L Hello Thanks for your book today listen Proust The Squid on I have 1 question have you considered Sanskrit Language while studying with other languages.sometimes you think a squid is an octopus and that’s OKAYhave gone unfarmed. While we were enemies, I still respect squid kid, I understand now that it is only with a worthy rival that one can reach their fullest potential. While he may have lost the war, he's gone from 70 subscribers to having tens of thousands of fans. So it can't bePotato War. Patience, discipline, carpal tunnel. I guess my main regret is that I bribed squid's discord admin to give my alt permission to see into his secret text channels and then HE NEVER USED THEM ALL YEAR. With the war over, squid took down his potato minions and my fieldsCOME ON WAS WAS THIS NECESSARY? WATCH ME DANCE SQUID KID YOU LOSE! YOU LOSE THE WAR! After the war, the admins added a temporary NPC to the Skyblock hub. The Potato King. It gave out a new talisman which boosted potato minions by 5%, a basket for the top 1000 potato farmers and can you drop a link for that i gotta show that to a few friends Hold your L with pride JSHSJ WOAH THIS LOOKS INCREDIBLE 😳😳 Are the octopi and squids cake????? Is the rainbow just a rainbow flavored cake???? Is boyfriend cliff a cake????? Aw that cute pink squid straw from team aloha? Thats cute RipJoseph, watching the news: Some idiot tried to fight a squid at the aquarium Zeco: Well maybe the squid was being a dick Did you fist a squid? 환장 저 대신해서 힐러리 사진첩 하나 만들어주세요(양심말아먹으며)ㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ 애들 모두 오래오래 살면서 다강이 아이엠그라운드라도 하고 놀았음 좋겠네요 근데 현실은 왜 이렇much he's farming. The admins saying that techno is just like so focused it baffled them at how like just insane he was. He had no breaks. I swear to God this technoblade dude is uh focused on another level. Towards the very end, squid had one of his goons write a program torealize the real number when he got a level 100 rabbit of his own because HE WAS BEING SABOTAGED. But the biggest reason my lead expanded by that much was because over those two weeks while squid averaged eight hours of farming per day, I AVERAGED 11. I just can't believe howof potatoes left uncollected in my minions. I also said that my minions now produce 1.58M potatoes but they're actually producing 1.75M. Because the rabbit pet doesn't actually boost your minions by 30%. It boosts them by 43%! Why? IDK IT'S PROBABLY BUGGED. And squid couldn'tas Sun Tzu says: "All war is deception" You see I knew after the second potato war video that things were going to get more difficult from here on out. Because at this point, squid had a full organization backing him up. He had goons, a cabal of billionaires funding his everynot. Dude that's actually like, it's not possible. No.. it's not. this can't be real.. Squid had been certain that he was right on my tail. I don't know how far behind I am 100 less than 30M. And yet when I won the war, I had a lead of over 88M potatoes. How did I do it? Its justup because I wasn't sure if intentional sleep deprivation was legally considered torture or not so I decided to shelf that strategy for the time being. And after sacrificing 2 weeks of my life I finally reached 500M potatoes. WE WIN THESE. Squid was shocked. He's at 4.99 no he'sbackup pet users is literally right there at the top of the first page. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE MISSED IT. But anyways squid logged off an hour and a half ago, he should be entering rem sleep just about now, it would be a real shame if someone woke him. I didn't actually wake himMEDICINE and I was like CAN I REALLY TELL HIM THAT I'M NOT GETTING HIS MEDICINE BECAUSE I NEED TO FARM POTATOES? CAN I REALLY LOOK I'M AN ATHEIST,BUT WHEN GOD SENDS ME TO HELL, I WANT HIM TO HESITATE, OK? I WANT HIM TO HESITATE FOR A FEW SECONDS. But squid was also farmingOk is going on and this young man making squid ink pasta from scratch. My lordt!BECOMES WORTHLESS. Suddenly my 45M potato lead goes from insurmountable to yes would confirm that in a couple days squid starts putting in crazy hours. If I do 12 hours a day, can he keep up? Absolutely not. People say Technoblade never dies, but I'm putting him in the grave.replants crops after you farm them and an item which automatically compacts items in your inventory so you don't have to spend time on that. You know, two minor changes which just so happen to buff squid's farming method from 200,000 potatoes to 1.2M. AND MY FARMING METHODto the winner. Now I was only at 300M potatoes at this point but I figured I had this in the bag, I mean I've been tracking squid's potato count, I accounted for his AFK coverage by having the discord bot track his alt accounts logins and I knew how much he was farming by handfarming at the same time. What are the odds he's farming right now? Five bits I bet Techno is doing the same thing just has like a 130% faster way to do it. Uh you're probably wrong. In this time I expanded my lead by another 5M potatoes but at this point, squid and I had beenpotatoes but his method could get at most 200,000 potatoes per hour whereas my method with double flycatchers even after subtracting the amount the minions would have made themselves could get 410,000 potatoes per hour. The next 3 weeks squid farmed hours everyday but I wasthe potato minions weren't quite fast enough to keep up, but I thought to myself if they're only going to be planting they don't need to waste an upgrade slot on a super compactor. So I spent another 250M coins to get 48 total flycatchers. Squid and I both started farming Squid people play paintball felt fun when I was. 7 福岡は旨いものいっぱいあるよw So forever? ty squid ily! tc always 🥺 It's ok you still smell niceSquid Squad - Splattack!

Perhaps, but Squid's entire channel practically revolves around The Great Potato War.

I read that octopuses, octopi, and octopodes (oc-top-o-dees) are all acceptable plurals for the word octopus. Which is your favorite? Would you rather fight a squid or an octopus? I beg of you, please sell the two 2020 posters to benefit some kind of relief effort. I didn’t know the “Squid of Government Incompetence” could be beat. Then I saw “The Boyfriend Cliff.” 111 Days of Hell indeed. Need copies. Reward the people! Gradually, Zara tried a few spells to force the squid away That’s a squid それは楽しみだあ！！ Imagine having a nose like squid word, Lmao stupid nn sit down lil boy ill tap you on the top of your head when its time to go! てへ☆Sidenote: the song continues to play after the D.I.E. hits. this is to me, is a reference to Veidt who betrayed his friends, teammates, and all the artists and writers who worked to create the Squid.The song itself can represent the D.I.E itself. An event that traumatized humanity into peace. (It also made humanity abandon a lot of new technology) The D.I.E, as we know...is a lie. The squid was part of the greatest practical joke of all time. いやそんな…今更改名してももうねこのてで定着してるし…改名してもねこのてって呼ばれるだろうし…スプラトゥーンニワカ晒し申し訳ない。いやもうそれは店員じゃなくて頭ヤベェひとだよ…allows squid to catch up that much more quickly. But I had a plan. The reason farming potatoes by hand is so inefficient is because when you break potatoes they don't grow back so 2/3s of the time you spend on farming is spent replanting the potatoesyou just harvested. Squid kidleveling up my farming skill, I was also leveling up multiple legendary rabbits. There's a reason I wanted to stop people from AFKing on squid's island even after he started AFKing himself. And it's because it's almost impossible for one man to AFK every hour of the day becausefarming day after day at times that farm for so long without break that the people watching thought I was botting. Word of my pumpkin farming soon reached squid who began farming pumpkins himself. But he only saw the surface level of what I was doing. You see I wasn't justthe act. Because I'm always getting comments saying OH MY GOD TECHNOBLADE WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN TO SQUID they don't understand THIS IS WAR. There's no holding back. I KNOW THAT AND SQUID KNOWS THAT. The only difference is that I'm 20 steps ahead he's playing Skyblock while I'mthing. HE IS ABOUT TO SABOTAGE ME! So I held a stakeout on my island, and guess what I found a few hours later? A brand new Skyblock account AFKing with a level 1 Legendary rabbit. Truthfully I could've stopped squid before he even joined my island but I wanted to catch him insquid knows I monitor tweets, but what he doesn't know is that that was MY alt account. For misrespective that could've been some random guy with a rabbit and if that was the case, I had no idea rabbits could be used that way. As such in line in that tweet, could only mean onehopper system, because it was me. But that's not the real reason he closed his island. After all, I'd been dropping rookie axes into his hoppers for weeks, but he sent that tweet 8 minutes after he kicked my alt. So I get to thinking WHY WOULD SQUID LIE ABOUT THAT? And I realizedstalking squid kid, I developed a bit of a, psychological profile on this man. I know how he talks, I know how he thinks. And when I saw this tweet, I instantly knew that this man was lying. Now don't get me wrong, I completely believe that somebody dropped rookie axes into hisrookie axe is even worse for players like squid kid who used the SkyblockAddons mod. Which has a feature which makes it very difficult to drop tools out of your inventory. The point is to stop people from accidentally dropping weapons worth millions of gold. But it also appliesIt took 4 long months, but it finally happened. But anyways back to his tweets. So squid says he closed his island because someone filled his potion system with rookie axes. A common trolling method in Skyblock is to fill people's inventory's with useless items like boats but theto stop them because what was I gonna do? Announce that AFKing helped him? THEN EVEN MORE PEOPLE WOULD AFK. I realized that the only way to stop this from happening would be to get squid to close his own island to visitors. Without him realizing that thats what I wanted all alongGONNA AFK TO HELP TECHNOBLADE WIN THE POTATO WAR and I'd beg them to be like NO DUDE PLEASE PLEASE HE FIXED THAT MONTHS AGO THAT DOESNT HURT HIM ANYMORE and they'd be like I'M HELPING and AFK all night.

You know, as a joke. Sometimes I would be on squid's island on an alt account and I'd see someone say in the chat I'Min the offline calculations so if there's at least one person on my island and squid's island is empty, I'd get 10% more potatoes! Now it was easy to get people to AFK on my island, what was difficult, was getting people off of squid's island, you see, even months after the firstI CANT TELL YOU CAUSE IT'S A SECRET and then like ITS OK TECHNOBLADE I KNOW THE REASON IT'S BECAUSE YOU HATE ME SPECIFICALLY :( I'LL JUST GO LEAVE FOREVER NOW and I'm like WAIT COME BACK NOOO. So squid closed his island which meant I couldn't sabotage him anymore BUT WHAT IF Ican bypass guesting limits. But unfortunuately, on March 20th, my alt was kicked and squid's island was closed forever. The jig was up. But by that point I'd already achieved my objective, the two weeks it took him to realize what was going on cost him about 2M potatoes.overriding his level 100 bonus. But my problems didn't stop there, you see. Squid got an alt account to AFK with his rabbit pet on his island while he was doing other things. And since the alt account had no reason to ever leave this island, it became much harder to keep controlto get our rabbits to level 100 I had a pretty heavy level lead and I thought'd it'd take squid several more weeks to get his there. But unfortunately an unknown third party got there first and sold his level 100 Legendary rabbit pet directly to squid. Of course he didn't forgetwhen I strike. Overriding his rabbit pet boost for the rest of the night. And yes I memorised squid's sleeping schedule to pull this off. I mean at this point, how is that even a question, of course I did. But unfortunately complications arose. Squid and I had both been rushingduring the day since you don't even have the pet out to keep priority. And since the rabbit was deactivated, if squid checked his minions during the day, he'd find nothing wrong with them. But every night around 2AM, squid would leave his account AFK and go to bed. And that'sthe second Potato War video to start. After that video tourists flocked to squid kid's island to see it for themselves. My alt blended right in. Everyday my alt would sit there in squid kid's AFK pool to maintain rabbit priority. In fact, I usually had the rabbit pet deactivatedLegendary Rabbit pet onto it and shipped it off to squid kid's AFK pool. I knew I had to maintain absolute secrecy. I didn't even tell my goons about this because I knew once squid got wind of this it would be trivialy easy for him to prevent it. I waited until the day I releasedlevel 1 one they wouldn't get their rabbits 30% boost, they'd get the level 1 0.3% boost. Unrelated fun fact, did you know that squid kid's island is still open to visitors? Yeah that's right. We're doing this again. So I bought a new Minecraft account. Slapped a level 1you can't just get 20 accounts with rabbit pets for infinite potatoes. But the third thing I found was the most interesting. And this is what squid kid didn't know. If there's multiple rabbit pets on the same island, which one boosts the minions? You think it would be theKid, the former rank , a man who's obsession with potatoes is rivaled only by my own. In my last video I talked how the newly added rabbit pet could at it's highest level increase the amount of potatoes my minions made by 30%. But I knew squid would watch my video to find outSkyblock: Potato War 3 (FINALE) My name is Technoblade and I am the fastest Skyblock player alive.

What? That’s not even Splatoon, the inklings can’t make animate dm things with their ink, they only use it as like a paint turf war. What, just because it’s a squid using ink? Do they see a squid in the ocean and say “wow, it’s Splatoon!” have" [small hiccup] "squid" "squid i found a problem with your island" "a critical flaw" "get over here" "OVER HERE" "SQUUUID" "SQUID GET OVER HERE" "this sign" "it has the WRONG NUMBER" [wheeze laughter] Pretty bad week for squid_kid overall I'd say: first he got arrested, and I think at this point squid_kid knew that the alts were mine, but he was so confused, "why?" Why had Technoblade been AFK-in on his island for weeks? He was so confused that he didn't even realize that his potato leaderboard spot had already been taken. So I went to confront him squid_kid's lead was almost completely destroyed. And yet, squid_kid himself had no idea. He even put a billboard on his island, "number one in potatoes." But why *would* he suspect, just a few days ago he'd seen proof on the forums that he was MILLIONS in the lead. The poor fool "Who called the po-lice?" "Whitelisted, are you squid_kid's alt?" "No— I just. afk here a lot. as a hobby," "I'M SO SUSPICIOUS. HE DOESN'T BELIEVE ME AT ALL, I'M GETTING BANNED" They'd been investigating while squid_kid was offline. I met him later that day and decided to warn Squid what the fuck i cant believe you said this. could be destroyed in a matter of days. STILL, to be safe, I kept AFK-ing on his island, until one day... I checked my alt's window for a moment and the island was full. Two guys I'd never heard of before had called the police on squid_kid and brought a helper to investigate him throw up—" Against a farm like that, I easily took rank number two. It seemed like I was only one step away from my potato dreams. And yet, squid_kid had been so dominant on the potato leaderboards that he was still three million potatoes ahead. But with catalysts such a lead you guys three guesses as to who left a funny rating on his post. SQUID_KID— I was right on his tail, but I decided to visit his island to see just how strong his potato farm was. "Oh, this is a joke. This-this is pathetic. Only eighteen minion slots, this-this is just sad. ninety-three thousand potatoes per day. I don't make hot potato books, I make hot potato LIBRARIES. Originally, I thought I'd have to go bankrupt buying catalysts if I wanted to catch up to squid_kid, but I actually discovered that catalysts are amazing! I can buy the materialsThe squid research lab proudly presents: a live performance by the Squid Sisters! stamped on them— could you imagine how much money I would make if I put this on the auction. I would make DanTDM's fifteen mil water bottle look like TAP WATER. He left a sign for me, "whitelisted what do you want from me—" [wheeze] I'm just ruining squid_kid's whole life *looks at your follower count* *it's higher than mine* Fuckin sellout. *takes a zerofucks bath* I suggest you find a other squid party. "IT WAS A GOOD PAINTING" I figured squid_kid would find it a little bit suspicious if the same guy was AFK at his island every day— so I got a second account! And then I LEFT THEM BOTH IN THERE! "Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness." "WHAT" them into the potato dome and it started making four hundred fifty thousand potatoes per day. And so, the days went by. Every day I'd log in and AFK on squid_kid's island with my alt, while my minions burned through hamster wheels, quickly bringing me into the potato top ten business and then— why is he there? I knew I couldn't rely just on sabotage to get first place because who knows if there's other people out there just like squid_kid, throwing away everything just to farm more potatoes. So I decided to look into alternate fuel sources for my on the island. Cause otherwise, skyblock just runs a calculation to guess how many resources your minions would have made while you were offline. Anyways he left the door to his AFK machine open so I LEFT MY ALT IN THERE! Welcome to the real world, squid_kid. Okay, can we take a My first thought was that but?? Squids make ink my dudes, it’s natural 🤪 screw the haters, do it regardless??? It’s such a cute idea tbh I wait to see what you do ;v; Fresh herbs with peas and baby broad beans is my favourite. But cheats bulgar wheat and squid risotto is also wonderfully tasty and really simple. I'd done it. I discovered a critical flaw with squid_kid's potato farm. His minions were too close together. Now, with any other kind of minion that wouldn't have mattered at all. But potato minions are unique; when they're too close together, they'll start trying to plant in LMAO It's cute. Though, I wouldn't want to be his enemy. Imagine being smacked in the face by a squid. 😁 journalism. I discovered a forum post from September which a user named im_a_squid_kid bragged about being rank number one in potatoes. By stalking his profile, I found another post weeks later in which he suggested he was now around seven million potatoes.
