Does anyone know if this is still true? for a dapples/short range kit, what would work well with ninja squid? I have the annaki red cuff with main ninja squid and I did want 3 subs swim speed with it but I have a sweater with that already xmx i know and i HATE IT give her squid arms coming out of her back or something jfc at least tali got some freaky feet 👀👀👀 Same but I always picked Tali over Liara because Tali looked more like an actual alien instead of a woman with squid hair New indie game called squids from space!Ate too much squid during dinner and here I am now, scratching my body like there's no tomorrow 'cos fck allergies *squid Hahahahahah youfinding it funny explaining how to turn on my ddr cab is that you gotta flip the squid I only know a lot of this cuz of competitive. Like how if you swim, squid jump, then throw, the bomb goes super far Squid fuck That Orangina squid lady comes to mind... なるほど笑 仲良かったん？ PFFFFFFFFFFFF-- Yeah, they did die to a flood. But if the flood still left land for the squids to ink, then why did all of the humans die? And wouldn't their bones be swept away in the ocean and be scarce?

Something like this should take at least 100,000 years due to a squid's fast evolution.our tomato lettuce cups. . .24 coconut and hand-cut goat cheese flounder fillet. . .30 foccacia (glazed chowder). . .9 horseradish squid and okra strings. . .6 No se puede con las Squid Sisters :( Splatoon_kazumiさんからバグを盗んだと聞きましたが本当ですか？FACT: Airplane flights cost exorbitantly in order to pay off monopolistic squid.

You're getting next level with your skills there, Inkie.i’m glad that the splatoon community goes apeshit wild when people post harmless pictures of two gay/lesbian squids holding hands but stuff like that makes it onto the square‘I dig shrill squids’ The giant squid has the largest eyes in the world.  Is that because you had a squid grafted to the top of your head? the worst part is that this hc originated from a famous splatoon blog that loves to make everything about squids sexual so now no one is allowed to use "ink mixing" in any other context lmao SQUIDS!With dandelion bells and squid (food) shells And roomful undertakers all in a row Squid speak Squid My inlaws love the squid.at least bring back the squid girl dress i really liked that oneI have no clue what to cosplay at Raicon like I know Gordon is a fav to go but idk if i can give him the justice squid deserves“Only gay squids are valid.”Me: *has two teenager squid OCs who have a crush on each other* drama blogs: Me: *ships two squids from the manga who are the same age as OCs* drama blogs: OMG FUCKING PEDOPHILE UGH WHAT A SCUM PLS AVOID THIS PROBLEMATIC PERSONi feel like Squidward when he moved into the squid community and everyday just blends together and is the same 🙄🙄☹️😑😑I just want Splatoon 2 clothes that both give me the build I want and don't make my squid look like a total dork is that too much to ask FinallyI like the explosion squid I would watch that movieTakoyaki!
