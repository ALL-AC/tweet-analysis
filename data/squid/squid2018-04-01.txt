Вот Канобу хуйню гонят, а цифры охуеть какие набирают. Если бы людям не нравилось, то они отписались бы. Но чего мне доказывать-то, ведь мы ничего не делаем и не умеем в отличии от вас(( Ну, чувак. Было больше людей, это раз. Второе, начинать с нуля, это не подхватить чужое. Третье, разыграть приз за 20 кусков и тем самым подкинуть себе людей это не успех твоих умений, это щедрость нинтенды в раздаче консолей на розыгрыш. Не твой успех-то. *неистово открываю чипсы*an atheism is a squid: unnoted and untractable Набрать 1,8к людей за 3,5 года — быть в игрожуре по версии . Довести до 8,5к за год — растерзать.

Болото вскрылось Только по моей инфе ты настолько от этого обоссался, что начал жаловаться нинтенде, мол, тебя подставили. Делай-делай, может пара школьников тебя посмотрит — вся твоя аудитория. Только мне нет никакого до этого дела 😏 Что тут началось-то. Роман, мне что, снова начать разбирать твои рецензии? Ты же пишешь вообще ни о чем, видеообзоры забиты филлерами с vhs-эффектами про твоего парня. Воды и тупого текста как в Игромании 2005-го. Вроде обзор на 10 минут, а контента на 2, в лучшем случае. Ну да, зато ты охотно выпрашивал халявные коды. Вот только давать тебе что-то после того, когда ты выдал убого качества рецензию — это нужно быть слишком милосердным.*lies down* I have 2 more squid comms to do I will get them out to the commissioners VERY soon but rn Im just very tired Я не хочу себя ассоциировать с той клоакой, у меня свои ресурсы, а автором я был там ровно 20 дней, до того как охуел от всей ебанутой внутренней кухни.
