Lmfaoooooo Jada got me crying Or a certain level of ignorance due to capitalist indoctrination Man, it's impressive that you managed to make me DISAGREE with someone shit-talking capitalism. Takes a special kinda stupid to do that. Who has no access to any of those you have a twitter right? And for those who don’t have Internet access there are libraries around still if you want to learn discipline Martial Arts is a great way to learn it There is no such thing as “getting help” in a capitalist society amigo i also never said these things are “made up” keem did but in Most modern cases they are not as extreme as believed// squid lookin plant took my braincells and calle dme a bitch Protesters are peaceful until they are not. Way too many examples of peaceful protestors looting/vandalizing houses and businesses not to be alarmed when they just break into your property. There are some who require more help true but most do not require more than the willpower to overcome their issues that is the truth Capitalist therapists do not want people to know i am not actually a communist however the downsides of capitalism are vile Since you have 0 idea of whom i am my words mean nothing to you and I understand that however there is wisdom in which i speak someday more will be enlightened That's so AWESOME!!!! love ur designs on squid but goodnight Kloki, rest well! :D ❤️ well you just have to save up 183 squid /3 No I'm not. You did the moment you typed "claiming it's not an illness when it's literally killed people" and people get treatment but how often does that work I've never heard of it working btw. I'm just stating what I know. All I'm suggesting is that it may be on a spectrum That is the result of feeling dependent on outside sources when theres countless books and philosophies that can be research as easily as one google search away private therapist do not care about how many patients kill themselves to them they are just a lost paycheck Anxious Squid Self discipline is merely a step one must also learn the skill of logic and reasoning most humans lack those skills That's anecdotal evidence dude. You can't use your own personal experiences and the ones you've heard of to reject the widely believed and accepted norm from thousands of people who literally study this shit for a living. もし返信あったら一生まとわりつきたい(●´∀｀●) goto bed squid No one is born at peace it is something learned and earned and can only be found from within From the people I’ve talked to it is yet the indoctrination by therapeutic foundations runs too deep そのうち黄金騎士になるんですな(●´∀｀●) Thats a rather simple view of what im saying Yes, because people who are at peace don't need fucking therapy in the first place. But for some of us, that's not an option. I can't just "Wish Away" my problems by trying harder. Im wit the squidSquid Sisters - Bomb Rush Blush (Burui Localisation) And i also find it odd how we at a point in history where therapy and “helpful” methods are rampant yet Suicide, Depression,Divorce etc are all at the highest points statistically in decades maybe because there is no room for improvement in a capitalist society Squid Legs so long he kind of looks like a land squid. I know the doctors and the therapist often make alot of money of regular patients rather than patients at peace Correction: Squid* Then that is your own personal experience, don't project it onto others, as if what you've felt is universal. Buddy, quit projecting. Maybe Self Discipline was enough for you, but there a lot of people out there with issues that can't be fixed with self discipline alone. To imply they can is just fucking stupid. I only know from what ive learned The human mind can do a lot. It can also suffer from a lot. But I'm sure you know better than the doctors and researchers who have poured thousands of hours into studying these things. “Self Discipline” and “just trying hard” are two completely different thing it is no surprise that those that compare the two don’t understand the meaning of either これは、買わなきゃ🤣 Everybody gets anxiety in certain situations the MENTAL ILLNESS is when the anxiety is getting in the way of life and how you do things スゴく増えておる！(;・д・) You don’t give the human mind enough credit but if tou want to go bankrupt following false self help methods go ahead Squid i do this as well nd its lots of fun!! u should share what it looks like when its done :D The peanut butter squid tentacles. -shudders- I am dead😭😂 Drive slowly and less aggressive pls! It’s a 30 in this part of the road! Sure...look at what happened in NYC, Chicago, Seattle, etc. during “peaceful protests”. The protesters need to separate themselves from the mobs. He was all the way on plan Z and still never got the formula though🤡 Falling vending machines kill people does that make it an illness? Hell people kill people does that make us an illness? My point is it might just be something everyone's born with and some people have a more extreme version of it.

Don’t like your body then work towards a new one nothing in life is given You may do that but other guy goes overboard with it :/ I do not believe everyone is constantly zen and at peace however i feel as if social media, the media and therapist make it seem as if self discipline and finding peace within ursef is a taboo and only threw expensive treatment can one be saved i think thats all a scam Same here pal multiple schools Suicidal thoughts until i learned to control and suppress my emotions and find a form of peace that takes everyday to overcome yet once a technique is learned it is relatively easy to maintain as long as you do not surrender Cool Ill start scolding my body when my anxiety gets so bad that I throw up cause honestly body just over it lol 🤡🙃 Question: What is next for you?I want some: Seafood Jaam Bbong.
