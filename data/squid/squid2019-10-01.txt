Kitler will pick fights with Abbey, she'll tackle him and he'll let out a cry of horror and play act like she vanquished him and then tackle her until she kicks his ass again Evil cat is standoffish, but she does enjoy her cuddles at night. The only reason I don't picture her on my feed much is because she hides. She is forever beating up derp cat, tho. Then he goes around crying since he's a wuss. "I'm not picky, so anything is fine. As long as it's not, like.. roasted cockroaches or live squid." True. Even Kitler loves us sometimes, regardless of the nips and swipes he does when we rub his belly without permission.
