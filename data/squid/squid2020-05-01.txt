RIP squid gang Squid scientists are the BEST people. When my son was little, he want to be a teuthologist. His hero — and penpal — Dr almost 20 yrs ago was Clyde Roper of the Smithsonian.

I like the dynamics of the light here thoughThe Squid Sisters shot a music video here a long time ago, didn't they? Any word on Outriggers,Squid Lips, and Capt Butchers? Happy birthday, Squid! Most squids are generalist predators and will eat anything they can catch--usually fish, crustaceans, other squid. Most of them lay their eggs and die before the eggs hatch with the NOTABLE exception of some deep-sea brooding species! Some octopuses seem to enjoy physical contact, but I don't think anyone has reported it for a squid... Many of the Central American refugees are escaping from death threats, deportation is often a death sentence. Shut up Pygmy squid!!! They are soooo cute! Interesting comparison! It's a bit different because giant squid aren't individuals of a smaller species who happen to grow large; they're an entire species of giants. 😃 I think there's still a lot of research to be done on squid hormones! あるあるですねw 笑っちゃうやつw Cuttle fish and SquidSquid Sisters - Fresh Start (Ama Localisation) ...but was the ink used for the print also from a squid? in case anyone in your house has squid 🦑 questions!

Good morning, YouTubers. And welcome to my meeting! Today, I am creating about peace among squids. :( Vm~ isn't that totally wild? their growth rates are off the charts! the way scientists figured it out is pretty neat, too--squid have these tiny little "bones" in their "ears" (technically statocysts) and you can count the rings in these bones to see how old they areIn case it isn’t obvious, squid wars = squidward Squid: more than calamari? Yeah that’s what I’m saying he never would’ve gotten in. 師匠！あいざいます！！I know only a little about squids.

Is it a squad? Because if it isn’t I’ll be mad. So Trump's incompetence led to less deportations than Obama. That makes a pragmatic case for supporting Trump, especially if you apply the same logic to foreign policy.YOU'RE KIN WITH THE SQUID YOU'RE KIN WITH THE SQUID YOU'RE KIN WITH THE SQUID YOU'RE KIN WITH THE SQUID YOU'RE KIN WITH THE SQUID YOU'RE KI *squid doggo noises* OMG, I WANT A SQUID SCIENTIST IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

And I learned things about squids, too. Ps5 for squids but other than that I’m bout it Literally the opposite. Trump wanted to deport more people and he ended up deporting lots of people and jailing everyone whos case was on hold be deported were held on custody. Kids separated from their families as well. For longer periods than the Obama administration did it. That is the reason why Obama deported more people. Not because Trump was not as evil and he said "I will deport less people than Obama"yeah whatever im a nationally recognized student i still cant erase the fact that i genuinely believed printer ink came from squids until sophomore year of high school The twitch community is fantastic too, and that definitely includes you!! There’s always at least a few people active which is great when I want to listen to some good ol squid game :D I dont know the number. He has deported less than Obama but he enacted stricter measures than Obama that would deport a larger number of people, and since he was planning to deport more people the deportation system could not be streamlined and as a result the people who would Squid. Flour, egg, Pablo. Hot oil. Eat all at once Fat Exact number? He has deported less* the squid sisters breath The Squid fishery along the Argentine EEZ boundary is perhaps one of the most high-value fishery that is totally unregualted because Govt's in Falkland Islands, Argentina, Uruguay could not form a RFMO; and distant-water fleets from China ad others are allowed to fish unhindered How many people has Trump deported? Nurse squid I agree. The DNC sucks Obama sucks Biden sucks Trump is worse. That is the only thing I have been saying the whole time and you are trying to paint me as some sort of DNC fan I first thought who is this squid and then I was like oh it's me not squidward i call you angry squid guy i hope the squid was not hurt to make the inkwhy was it called the little mermaid and not squid pro quo JK, it's still horrifying.

(wet crunching noises) Can squids recognize their own family members or are they solitary creatures? Three million deportations seems pretty harmful to me, it's also safe to assume many of those people also had families in the USA.Poseidon was really fuckin squids and dolphins back in the day and his worshippers thought that was normal? The ghetto They’d have let him into the school but he wasn’t passing the entrance exam or doing extremely well in the sports festival. 😡 they are not justifying it. They are saying that Trump was more harmful. That has been my thesis the whole time Although you need to remove your mask, damp squids are not in fashion.hi u eat squids mode I doubt an human rights lawyer would think that millions of deportations is somehow justifiable. I expect a creature: Crab, Landshark or giant squid. if you played splatoon 1 on the wii u you will like 2. if you haven't it's like a third person shooter, you shoot ink and try to cover as much 'land' as you can, you can turn into a squid in your own ink and go faster. it's a pretty fun game, maybe watch some gameplay videos.

(If you have time for non-sidewalk questions) wonder how you can be this stupid and think that this is how law works smh you seriously cant be this dense Academic feminism is a thing though. immigration lawyers are LITERALLY an authority on immigration law. Feminism is not a qualification. Wonder how many of those immigration lawyers work night and day to make those millions of deportations possible. squid 🤝 reena being the cutest beings i ever did see Read the thread also SQUID FACTSsquid and octopus have 3 hearts jealous One of my RE teachers at school used to love telling a particularly long-winded joke whose punchline was: “Hans that does dishes can be soft as Gervais, with vile green hairy lip squid.” I have absolutely no memory of what the build up was, though 🙂 that is a horrible, embarrassing analogy, because feminists are not an authority on sexual assault while immigration lawyers are an authority on immigration law i like relaxing by smashing young squid kids with a giant roller. i would die for squid but i’d rather kill for her Feminism by definition discriminates against non-binary people. ooh kinda sounds like the squid boys in upper Cathedral Ward 🦑 Chill I don’t be like that. I’m the cool, calm coach. I don’t do all that screaming lol I agree. Keeping them and planning to deport even more millions than the other guy is an even bigger crime against humanity.

Squids with benefits much, at the very least as far as immigration goes, the Trump administration is worse than the DNC in EVERY possible way Aawh, yeah, that's happened to be before as well! When I first started out. But I figure I might as well be the nice player that plays fair/doesn't prey on the new squids, just so they have a chance! If no one else will then I gotta!! :D Anyway, thank you!! I'm glad you like it! they want to deport EVERYONE that makes it harder for them to streamline their deportations, and thus the system is clogged. And thus, the people who are in line to be deported just stay in custody. The Trump administration made it harder to obtain visas AND legal status. pretty counting the number of deportations is a really stupid way to measure this,. Trump deported fewer people because he kept everyone on custody. He kept people who would have been released. Also, the Trump administration WANTS to deport more people than Obama would but because No problem!!!
