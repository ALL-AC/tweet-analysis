BF has been a mess at the launch of every BF since 3. That's is entirely on DICE. They ignore the majority of input and constantly make poor gameplay decisions The game is so far removed from the games that dropped before 3 that it hardly feels like BF anymore. To be truthful i dont have a problem with it yes it has a few bugs but nothing really detracts from the gameplay its fast and frenetic i think alot of people cant get away with it because how casual BF1 was i went back and played BF1 and was surpised how slow it was. こんちゃーこんちゃー As a Squid Sisters fan ?

A simple addition that would solve a lot of issues. Also what's the deal when (sometimes) you try and spawn on a friendly flag it has the messege "spawn point selected no longer availible" even when it's a spawn point the enemy aren't even contesting... Why is this still a problem.What do squids think about when you travel constantly, don’t sleep and a. And I know they have to deliver whatever will be in "Tides of War" first. If I had the option to do challenges and unlock a prosthetic arm, I'd definitely do it. More content, more customisation, and it looks pretty cool too tbh. Tbh I really want to see the customisation DICE removed. Let's be honest everyone who criticised BFVs customisation aren't even playing the fucking game right now, even though they got what they wanted. The stuff was cool imo, and it's content to work towards too. Poor squid Definitely. I don't like to be negative about a BF game. But I think they should just start over with a new BF game, BF5 has just left a bad taste for most people. Lack of color or shadows that highlight icons on UI is defimetly annoyance (more problematic in snowy places and in Hamada) I do like the minimap. Looks clean and easy to read. What I don't like is how the game mode info is not there too, and how the health is separated from the ammo. That has to be fixed imo. Whilst it isn't a major issue, it still really annoys me. I think BF overall should go the Forza route with actual differing titles with a 4 year dev cycle with each installment i.e. (BC3 in 2020, BF6 in 2022 etc). BFV needed an extra year of development imo. BF1 was way more stable at launch than what BF5 is right now. Also, BF1 took almost 3 years to make, BF5 took 2 years. It's a full of regression from previous games. Shit changed for no discernible or justifyable reason. Quality dip in UI from BF4 to BF1 and then again to BFV is just shocking and also kind of incredible. If the same happened to the game's visuals , BFV would look like a N64 game. Isn't our G-spot in our butt? Exactly... too much info on the screen at the same time. It should all be paired together... It should be the standard for an FPS game at this point. Almost feels like it still is 🤣 Sounds like all PC issues... and once again why they need different Weapon profiles for each platform.maye… hats jus tme, though.,.. tme, the squid… Yea, BF5 UI/UX is, do a lot more effort for the same thing Even spawning on a flag (aka the most safe spawn) takes more effort, bonuspoints if you want to change your weapon ehhh, again, I don't agree but that's my feeling, my main issue was the white-on-white design. A simply reply to your tweet I log off log back into 100+ notifications!!!! Is this what fame feels like???? 😂😂😂 I have learned to like the skulls. A nice addition imo. But ffs WHY IS THE HEALTH NOT WITH THE AMMO?? And why on earth is the compass tiny and above the map? It should be at the top of the screen like in the campaign... So many issues with the HUD imo. BFV in-game UI makes you look in more places than BF4 to get the same amount of info. To me, that's not good. I'd like health back above ammo, game mode details above mini-map and ribbon compass at top of screen. Whether that happens... eh. i was max rank after 20 or so hour The visibility in Battlefield 5 is terrible. There is no way anyone can deem it to be good and it takes so much away from other positive factors in the game. The criticism is completely justified imo. I'm not going to pretend things are ok when they are not. eh, I don't have issues with these. I only agree with gamemode stuff should be above map. Moment of silence for our fallen squid friend Its so simplistic Spamfire SLR's, no sips (Ez macroable too!) AR's, pull down and hold lmb, or crouch and hold lmb (Since crouching removes recoil) My number one complaint from the alpha. Nothing changed. Incredible. Just gonna put it out there, even though it isn't a super important issue, the in-game HUD for BFV is awful...Those who like to N'joy these Ipoh style-M'sia seafood starts STUFFING CRAB CLAW n SESAME SQUID RINGS with any type of Beverages. Ooh! Yumilicious😋😋👍 — feeling hungry Terrible contrast, useless compass, super messy, big strings of text blocking out vital info (like how far a flag is capped) bad layout (why is health not above ammo, why are gamemode items not above the map) aka less usable screen  Preach!!!🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 안녕하세요! 트친소에 흔적 남겨주셔서 팔로하고 갈게요!!😆😆Squid Squadのプロモーションビデオも街頭テレビから流れているぞ！ 他のバンドは...わからねぇな Dannys BFV Where's Wally video pretty much sums up the state of BFVs visibility. easier when it's moving. but I agree visiblity is an issue Not for most players though. Try playing Fjell on a PS4 lmfao... Most players complaining are likely conso0le players, and since graphics on console are potato compared to PC, they'll have a hard time seeing things. I mean CoD has a dedicated studio for each title for a 3 year cycle with minor technical changes other FPS franchises are taking even longer (i.e. Halo Infinite will probably is a 2020 AKA 5 year dev cycle). DICE is way more ambitious in scope than other AAA T/FPS devs. いちごのほろ酔いきちゃぁぁぁぁ！ってなってつい；； in game UI is fine menu UI yea it's fucking awful Also how can i forget another thing that's totally broken The visibility holy shit its bad Which is why I wish BF6/Next Mainline BF ain't going to be released till 2022 (maybe a BC3 in 2020 if possible), more than 3 years developing a title please because even the polished BF1 launch was plauged by a lack of content in general in the launch windowBaby squids are drawn with a big sharp top tooth in their mouths, i hc thats a baby tooth and it falls out, later growing TWO top sharp teeth bottom one just grows a single sharp tooth again ;0 the amount of people who used it was probably less than what is needed to maintain it. oh come on, almost no one used it, it was so useless anyway. Its like being proud of getting a record of longest shutdown in history xD I am not bashing anyone, I love this frnachise and I love Dice, But its just hard to keep being positive when Dice go 2 steps forward and 7 back.. It seems as tho everything about BFV (apart from the TTK) was done within 2 mins and i just cant take it anymore.. im sorry. I did. no, it was hard as fuck and never worked lmao. check stats and wank off ur kd Thing is it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Know how many people get influenced NOT to buy games from the crap on youtube? Alot. I've personally ran into gamers that didnt by it to begin with because of youtube and now are in LOVE with BFV in current state. Yeah, launching with literally the worst video game UI/UX of all time is not a commendable achievement, but sure that is something unique to BFV. 😁 Honestly could spend an extra year of dev time with polish + more features + and more maps at launch. Like 9 or 10 at the launch window is way too meagre. I'd rather wait for an extra year for like 14 maps day one + more polish features + smoother post-launch cycle. People are already forgetting the shitshow BF4 was, and IMO that should never be forgotten. Sure the game works now, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't learn from it, and be even angrier when its repeated Amen!!!! If in 6months these features still aren't resolved then let's start asking questions , yes there are bugs but let's put some faith in the Devs to fix them but give them time to do so answer: maybe like 1% of the 10% who kept playing the game. キャリバーさんかわいいやん？ did anyone actually use it? いちご買い占めちゃった(´ω∂`)☆ Bugs aside the game is awesome. I have been level 50 since the 9th day of release and still find time to play just about daily. To me advertising was the biggest disappointment out side of bugs. you could argue BFV launched with other things that old BF games didn't have. Yea, it's sad RSP or proper platoons aren't in but the game still has lots of stuff. We aint even have the companion app, atleast BF1 had that launch :p Also true^ Yes DICE will eventually fix it, but that does NOT mean we have to forget the issues even exist in the meantime. If an issue is present, people will naturally complain until something is done about it. People complained, it has reached a point where it's just too much. BFV launched without RSP, or Coop, or Battlelog, or Platoons. The older games launched with more systems and more to go wrong. 1: ranking 1-50 you can still upgrade all your weapons and vehicles if you from the CC u get + you have daily mission. 2: the game even without those features (which are btw free because fuck premium) the game had a shit ton of stuff. If you don't complain nothing will ever happen. I literally forgot that dragging was supposed to be a thing. That's how amazing EA marketing is... Well 50/50 BF4 was bad on all fronts, but in BF5 you could atleast join a match something that wasn't possible with BF3 during launch However BF3 behaved a lot better on the longer run Thank you, it seems simple but pretty hard to put out on paper If that is true then Battlefield must have had some SERIOUSLY rough launches before BFV then... I don't believe that ALL other titles launched worse.. If that's true then DAMN DICE need to spend more time developing their games. They release way too early. BF4 siege of Shanghai at launch: crash when tower comes down 😂 YOOOOOOOOOOOOO that's a meme right there. sorry, but this is a complete lie, you surely would know BF3 was also a mess and BFH with it's content meme. Vital items don't work (progression) Promised features are massively delayed (dragging/coop) I'd say BF4 is still the worst launch, but I'd put BFV next. あーーー おいしそー！！ how thoWhat do you call a psych ward for squids? A squidward It had feature parity of BF4? what do you mean Also the netcode was confirmed the best for that time (ofcourse it got beaten when a visceral engineer broke the 30hz lock and tested it on BF4 CTE ) BFV is by far one of the most stable launches only surpassed by BF1 (that's what happens when EA give DICE 3 years to develop a BF game) I'm sure that anyone who HAS played other games at launch may still think BFV is at least one of the worst. Maybe not the worst though. Didn't BF4 take a year to fix properly? Tbf BF4's launch was apparently horrendous. Never played that at launch as I was advised not too. So I guess the reason why I class BFV as the worst is because I made sure not to put myself through the pain of playing other games at launch :P You could argue the same about BFV. BFH wasn't broken because the amount of things that could have been broken was a meme. The game was one tenth of what an average BF game has at launch. Just because it can be worse doesn't mean this is any good. 🤔 Sure just because i can't sing doesn't suddenly mean can sing :p ほ！？ちょっと待ってDM行きます BFH was the first Battlefield launch that wasnt broken AF lol Even BFBC2 and BF2 had servers issues day 1 also bfvietnam but that's too old for this discussion. さっすが現役！やりますねぇ！(ここぞと語録) If this is the worstlaunch you've seen you haven't played: bf3 bf4 bfhardline なっ、なんですか！？Had to ditch the squid because took it. 😅😅😅 Not mad, I agree with you. You’re just such a squid. But no one actually makes a big deal of them. Every point I've seen brought up so far by the community is a very valid one imo. I love BFV, but my God there are SO many things wrong with it right now. One of the worst launches I've seen. I was having a convo about this very thing the other day. Freaking community can kill a game faster then anything, and that is all they are doing. Meanwhile I'm like did anyone even play BF4 the first 2 years?(I alway compair everything to that shitshow) The whole progression system is based around CC, which still isn't 100% fixed 2 months after launch. Progression for ToW doesn't track properly either. I can't think of many liitle bugs that people care about. There are little bugs, like animations not triggering, etc. 流石17歳JK！若さパワー流石です！！🤗 Very true. Yes, I don't like when people make such a big deal over little things, but to be quite honest, there are hardly any little bugs in the game. Most bugs are huge and are completely game-breaking. What about a famitsu USA lol I’m trying to get some new gear for my octo/squid dude. Too bad even weapon progression (getting better stats) are tied into the ccoins. lol. Danny is right tho I do think the game was playable day one, and it's not like you couldn't unlock weapons and upgrade them :p CCOINS isn't a tiny fault and actually is pretty gamebreaking since the WHOLE progression system is based around it. istream on twitch i get alot of viewers asking me about the game i give an honest opinion which is yea the games bugged it needed a few months more work before release but with some good patches it will be a great game it is playable and enjoyable when not dealing with bipod scum I don’t think they like squid.

I gave up on BF4 due to some of the issues it had, did go back eventually. Bf1 worked but had zero content until the dlc's but bf5 has that spark, it's got that gunplay that makes the game consistent once the issues are fixed tides of war gets going it will be a a great game! Good Squid!!Two kinds of adobo will be served tonight - the drier, red one (atsuete), with pusit (squid). My mom makes adobo with pork, chicken + chicken liver hearts.

[Switch] splatoon 2 - LPNext Squid - Splatoon 2 EU Community Cup hosting on my channel... ;) Ok I've got a video to upload to my channel too which this clip is part of so I'll put both onSquid Sisters - Fresh Start (Adhola Localisation)Spongebob: Aw, cheer up, Squid! It could be worse! Patrick: Yeah. You could be bald and have a big nose.

I could go on and on, but I don't wanna spam (even more) 🤣 たしかにwwww Yea SWBF2 had a rocky start, but it wasnt due to it being broken Yea i got bf3 like half a year before bf4 was released I’d want to draw something Splatoon! Like my inkling, or the squid sisters! :D Yep, as i said, got it at day one I know you got bf3 late Yeah, both games ran incredibly smooth at launch. The Battlefront games had quite solid launches, too. Did you actually play the game at launch :p? Honestly never had any of those problems you mentioned, maybe im extremely lucky 1. Doner kebab. 2. Proper full English breakfast 3. Chopitos fritos (fried baby squid) 4. Baguettes 5. Leberkäse Or that patch that broke all sound for everyone Well its not like you can ignore how broken the game is in its current state.. Classic Shoot a silenced dmr, server goes quiet あるある…(´･ω･`) この状態でもまだ夢見ちゃったりするからディスクは罪深い…( ･᷄ω･᷅ ) Agreed I know the feeling. 😘 Take down the tower, server crashes Shoot a piece of wood on siege and the server crashes I could say the same for BF4 then, never had a problem with it and played it since day one Youre in luck then Nope. Tides of war is noy bugged for me. Boy Harsher - Fate Lizzo - Juice Self Esteem - The Best Beabadoobee - If You Want To Another Sky - Avalanche The Murder Capital - Feeling Fades Squid - The Dial Stella Donnelly - Old ManSquid Sisters - Bomb Rush Blush (Boselewa Localisation) Yes Even comparing to BF4, it maybe was a broken mess, atleast it was feature completeNext time you feel uneven, remember that the parallelism squid is known for its 100,000 androgenic forearms. I feel like maybe something was influencing this opinion I think we can all agree that BFV is the most un-finished BF game that was ever released. 박쥐님 트친소에 흔적남겨주셨어서 이렇게 찾아왔습니다🙈🙇‍♀️ 실수시라면 스루해주셔도 괜찮습니다! 아니시라면 선팔부탁드릴게요(๑･̑◡･̑๑) Y'all remember *clears throat* B A T T L E F I E L D F O U R its the best squid dish everrr These youtubers know exactly what they are doing.

Yeah that too xD I only played that game for 2 weeks and all the Asian servers disappeared Pickled squid brains with marmalade. Squid and for me. Bfh too! Darnit Yeah, basically only BF1 was functional at launch, too bad it was a dumbed-down game Not even for the yikes of war stuff? No problems with them tbh honest. ahhahah iiniisp ko yung squid , bagal naman mag function ng brain ko  What about the assignment tracking? Besides Company coins :lul: Are you on glue? Hows your company coins? Well, I've never encountered a problem tbh honest.  Ehhhm, u serious? Hahahhahahaha ですね〜 なんてったって明日は平日ですからね_(:3 」∠)_ So is BFV... Even BFBC2 and BF2 had server issues at launch Hey, BFH and BF1 where 100% functional on day 1 Remember when Splatoon didn't have awful region exclusives like Traditional Clothing and Squid Girl by Famitsu brand?Good morning squid shits People tend to forget that BF3 was extremely buggy at launch (I was on X360) and BF4 was literally unplayable and only got fixed 2 years later. 蛸ちくわとRINも追加でCraving for giant butterfly squid 😩😋 フォローありがとうございますよろしくお願いしますヾ(●´∇｀●)ﾉI wonder if the cream on the salted squid I had before I went to sleep went rotten.
