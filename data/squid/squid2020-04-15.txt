The end.Squid Sisters - Maritime Memory (Aklanon Localisation) I haven’t watch souness but I’m sure he’s a great player with what I’ve read about him, but you shouldn’t be supporting him when literally he’s the one at faults, asking a player who’s 27 to bring out his trophies when you only had 5 more throughout your career is dumb We have our worst start in 30yrs, I don’t mean our worst team since the club was founded, and I’m sure you know what my point is, you just take it the wrong way NICEi was getting cramps while eating and my first thought was “this is bc you’re eating salty food so your muscles r contracting like a dead squid getting soy sauce poured over it” I could completely wrong but I never took the stuff about squids in polyethylene bags to be that obscure.
