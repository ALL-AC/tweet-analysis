Don't tell me where the squid comes in, I hate spoilers 😄 squids gonna squid Anything can happen in the beautiful game VERY BEAUT MUCH PROUD Yeah Atletico is a tall mountain to climb but not impossible Even if milan finish of a miracle , it’s impossible to beat Atletico madrid , regardless they have to try to win for the value of the shirt they’re wearing Looks like it was 3v2 cause of three squid partiers. Still that's a great score :D Squid Girls' outfit was even gear in the first game. It would've been the only gear I used had it been closer to my desired stats. So you only follow teams when times are good but not when they’re down? Look at it this way guys. If we get eliminated Thursday we can concentrate on the league where we’re only 6pts out of that 4th UCL spot with a game in hand. I’m pretty confident about us making it one way or another had to arrange to meet with client to drop-off previous batch of files, , because we had to dodge a strange, one-armed guitar player, a quick coffee meeting transformed into an hour-long, boozy lunch, with wine, oysters, squid tempura, fried fish brioche, wine...Arrrr! Give me back me puffle ye scoundrel squid! Don't k ow if this is a fact or anything but the creator of squid girl made one of the first ever fan art of this game. Ok I do not remember the squid. Maybe I was the one who was drunk. Then you should support them on thursday Saw it as a kid and remember it being this weird mix of obviously fake stuff and kind of creepy murder-suicide. Also, a giant squid He likes squids too dammit. "Oh! Hehe.. You must be new indeed, Friend! Inkopolis is the big city above Octo Canyon where a lot of Inklings and some Octolings live together!"

Remember what kaka did in Old Trafford? Well I hope he can bring that charisma on Thursday :)For sale, greasy squid, seriously loved. Nothing really. Now she's just saying Milan won't score on Thursday! lol np big squid any pic of a squid would do tbh You may be right! our strong suit is defending not scoring goals but when we do score we win. That being said Silva and Cutrone are playing together so theres a good chance of goals Yeah don’t forget Remember in 07 when Gattuso owned the midfield and shut down Cristiano Ronaldo like a bitch and sent your ManU boys home? I do :) that kid in the ringlets is only pretending he's not into that squid limbs deal Seriously? You want to talk about the champions league?i dont want steven to become a squid  yeah i agree. As long as we score one early and keep them off the board I think we can equal it up and win in extra time.  Very hard , an early goal is the only thing that can give us any chanceWhen that octoling update comes out you won’t see any more Splatoon squids online Don't be so sure Arsenal will score at home. They're very inconsistent and Milan has a world class defense. The first goal they scored was a deflection (lucky goal). Don't be surprised if Milan shuts them out. I actually expect that. The question is can Milan score 2 goals? Dunno love it when splat tim turns into splat squidsomeone tell me why a group of squids ain't called a squad ??? shit just gets me heated idk I’ve never seen a man utd fan care so much about arsenal to the extent of defending them 🤦🏻‍♂️ Yeah for home. Munchkin brought home what he thought was a field trip paper. Yeah, no, it's an info re a squid dissection. 6th placed sevilla just roasted 2nd placed man utd. Killing squid kids is my passion How did we miss that 🤔 I love it Her beloved team (man utd) with all their money lost from sevilla who never reached a quarter final from 60 years haha , we should feel sorry for her 頭でバイオハザードでもあったんでしょ仕方ないね Why are you so butthurt? If we score first we can do it cause it's not likely were going to allow 2 goals to be scored on us again. The first goal they scored was deflected (luck) any way. If we even it up I think we will win in extra time. I'm fairly confident about this game and very hopeful. :”( you're comparing two sixth place teams. what a strong league argument you have there lol but I won't argue with you there. Arsenal is terrible and Milan losing to them was an embarrassment. Completely unacceptable lol ありがとうございます。アングル決めるのに結構苦労しましたね… no Quick search turns that it's "Woomy United Today" which supposedly is a movement to keep all squid parties friendly and invitingI'd rather be raped in the arse with a squid jigger than have dis flu Ok have a great night! I hope so. Milan believed the hype when they were riding high on that streak and didn't take a struggling Arsenal seriously and paid for it. That being said Arsenal is so inconsistent, they could bottle this one. Milan beat Roma 2-0 at Roma (who's a better team) so it's possible. Yeah I hope we'll see Squid Squad return as well if they're bringing back the Splat1 bands! I still hold Splattack most everything else, so yeah where's Squid Squad I miss Squid SquadRobbie Rotten themed squid characterSYD SQUID I NEED MY SOLDIER OF THE ROYAL COUNCIL FAM COME OVER AND BOP TO WITH ME PLZZZZ  WAIT WHAT— NGGNBGHNJDFKGJKCFJJFHCJFHDGHSD I mean when we get down to it, neither League has won anything in the last 5 years. SerieA has 2 finals appearances and EPL has none. That being said: Arguing over who's 2nd best is a true losers mentality. LaLiga is and no sane person would dispute that  It’s all facts here , have some reading 📖 I'm also referencing a dumb meme I saw with the Squid girls amiibosThere are stories where the Giant Squid fucks Harry in the ass. I just cannot bring myself to be shocked by fandom anymore. everything i said is easy to confirm. All the results are online. If you don't want to accept them than this argument is pointless like I said. 服の皺見ればコラじゃないってわかるとおもう(適当) How about Korean food at a dive bar? If you want spicy, get the squid and pork.

It's a door way to the real tournament nothing more. Have a good day. OR, they could throw a real curve ball and have a live festival with squid sisters/ off the hook performing while the stage is in front of them. That would be pretty cool. 強そう(KONAMI) ダブルアタックとかトリプルアタックに強そうだなって思った It's funny because that's exactly what the Squid kids should be doing I keep hitting you with easily researchable facts but you don't want to accept them lol In the last 10 seasons Chelsea won and Inter won. That's 1 win for each league. ManU made it to a final and lost and Juve made it to 2 finals and lost so in the last 10 years SerieA has been more successful internationally. Sponsors and money haven't helped with results. VERY GOOD WAHMENToday is White Day in Japan, when girls who gave Valentine’s gifts get a return on their investment. In April, Korea also has Black Day, a day for lonely souls to eat black food together.

But are you okay now? ホラーゲームかな？ The giant squid in the TV movie “The Beast” from 1996Seriously why does everyone want to fuck squids now jfc I just hit you with a ton of facts and have made your argument null and void yes and i took offense to you calling my league a "farmers league". You can't claim EPL supremacy when they haven't won any more titles than SerieA in recent years. They're basically both tied in 2nd to LaLiga. EPL just has more money but that doesn't equal results.Is a squid not entitled to the ink on his brow? Oh lmaoMaybe it was just the morning, so I almost thought I saw a squid mango being sold in the supermarket. EVIL Squid! WOW WOW WOW Can’t believe your skill. And oopsdid interrupt your role play?

I’ve been wanting to go for years because I’ve never been and Justin doesn’t want to so let’s just go together 🤷🏻‍♀️ 湖上のくぅーもー(=^ェ^=)What's the whole deal with squids.Aaaaahhhhh these two squid kids were having a…. Congrats, Squid! Excited for your growing fam! Alright Ian, I finished the pod. And sfter giving it 10 mins of thought, here is my draft: 5,000 mosquitos (to annoy yall) 4 Giant Squid (ocean dominance) 50 Golden Poison Dart Frogs (hybrid) 35 Grizzly Bears (land attack) 40 Great Grey Owls (covert ops) Leggenda 😂 A pod of squid should be called a squad no i just noticed you're a ManU fan and I like City so I thought i'd rub it in. bottom line here is La Liga is the best league of the last 10 years and for the 30 years prior to that it was SerieA. Before that it was LaLiga and before that SerieA and before that LaLiga. The EPL has never been . They were a retirement league like the MLS for SerieA greats. If you like a lot of goals and no attention to defending than yes the EPL is a more exciting league. I'm not one of those people. When I see a lot of goals being scored it means that defenders blew their assignment and the manager didn't teach them defensive tactics. 卑猥スター… 😂😂😂😂 I just love that City is going to win the title this year. The real Machester fans support city and all the world wide band wagon fans that don't know football support United. I love it :) they all say it cause most people are idiots. EPL is popular and exciting cause there is more goal scoring cause none of the teams know how to defend like Italian and Spanish clubs do. Also the fact that the games are broadcast in English makes it more attractive for sponsors. I was actually thinking of replacing them with the Squid Sisters logo but that's actually a thousand times better! 一目惚れしてしまったのだよ.... without money in the equation Italy dominated football. Now the EPL has a ridiculous amount of money compared to Italy and they still don't win any more titles or make any more finals lol what does that tell you? They can't even buy championships in England lol No doubt you can figure it out, Tolkien 😜 "urgh, no mum.

Imo I thought the boys hair looked really bad in the trailer but with other gear it makes the design look so much better especially with a hat even though it cover the tentacle the design still looks great also those glasses look cute as hell on the octoling And I bet you would do a fine job Marine.Just a former Squid here,for what its worth,I would follow you into a battle against these facists✌ "Come on eat your desiccated squid and marinated fennel or you won't be allowed to watch Akira Kurosawa's Throne of Blood.

I've had this sign hanging in my house that says "congratulations on your giant squid...even though you don't deserve it" and that's what LA feels like to me. Good reminder to stay humble and focus on your own shit instead of worrying about other ppls squid. 昨日食べちゃった！"why do you hate pool party lulu?" even though it's hard to see, but if she wore a cuter swimsuit and riot didn't dump all the resources into the autistic squid, i'd actually consider using it more. even IRL toddlers wear fancier/cuter swimsuits than that shit.New card sighting: Squid Grid (Undersea Farming, 900 points) for 20Tx from Sydney next time im caught crying its because of the squid sisters performing 'fresh start' at the off the hook concert at tokaigi 2018 Make em cat squids Yes we should....

It's all downhill from here.Speaking of which, I think Splatoon has an interesting fantasy racism going on. The protagonist Inklings are the jerks, not the octopi. They just want electricity, and the squids took it. イカちゃんしゅき… おやすみー...Range Blasters! So I guess you can call this The Range Blaster Squid Party! イカちゃん気合いでがんばって… わては寝る。 Bulky squid 🦑 ...like really😒.
