LIKE WHAT CAN I SAYSquid Sisters - Calamari Inkantation (Ainbai Localisation) Hate speech is about reinforcing hierarchies. It's about cultural power dynamics. It is NOT about the speaker's "intent," and "taken out of context" is no defense. "Trophy hunters are lower than squid shit." Ed Abbey For hate speech, "intent and context" matter only when otherwise hateful words are used as endearments *within the group those words target*. Eg, woman to female friend: "You sweet bitch." Not hate speech. If a man says that: hate speech. No matter his intent or the context.

Man I’m pissed😡😡😡😡😤😤😤😤 A slur is hate speech by it's use in a negative context.
