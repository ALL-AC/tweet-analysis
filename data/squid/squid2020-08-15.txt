Pas vraiment envie de parler.. I see your point, very fair. Which he gave away 150 million of it lol. You want him to give away all most of his fortune which is absolutely nonsense.

I know in my heart that you’re right, but squid..ward Such a great movie. I use to get so excited whenever it came on TV when I was a kid.

I liked the skin directions they were going, I hated the tank and airplane play, TTK changes and a lack of community games. The game just wasn’t good compared to past titles, and they never fixed it. They did not listen to the community in those regards and that why people left And yet we are squids in! We are scaling the heights (help me)It sucks seeing all my biker friends riding free with no gear on, just squidding away not giving a fuck about the fact that pavement is a literal skin cheese grater and it’s really making me miss being a squid even though my road rash scars might say otherwise 😂🦑🦑🦑 Lol about what exactly? I know they toned back on skins but they really didn’t listen to the community about anything else.. TTK changes, bugs, gameplay issues, lack of content, no team balancer, no community games, no anti cheat.

They are going to try and build the game they want but ultimately it will be the game EA wants and if the community does not like it then Battlefield will be dead. I have no doubt that the community will ultimately be ignored.. he’s technically an octopus tho... whenever they go to the surface/out of water his puppet was always an octopus and not a squidWill most likely stream my first couple +2 sets tomorrow morning after my finals. Fall semester starts about 10 days later so I'll be streaming scrims likely every day until then. I'll try to make a consistent stream schedule to play Squids but also to have time to myself.

And I'm not alone, there are others that have similar stories from working with him. Do not trust Squid, do not work with him, do not grant him the time of day at all.PSA: the commentator Jamie "Squid" Stewart is an abusive, conniving and manipulative troll who, under false promise of payout, forced me to cast exclusively for EFL, fully redesign their stream layout, and chewed me out on the daily for the most banal of things.

Grilled Squid!And so we begin the hunt for the great vampire squid And every time you call manny a self-insert your argument loses credibility bc you’re just lying.

I'd rather pass away. What good does "standing up to China" (whatever that means) do when the 1%ers are sucking up our wealth like a giant vampire squid? We are the wealthiest country on earth, but starting in the 80s the middle class has been robbed. Wake up! "China" is a distraction.Can't even think about odd looking creatures without thinking about that stupidly big deep sea squid that looks straight out of a sci-fi movieKikiam at squid balls at 3am 🤤 My main question is a BR part of Dices vision for BF6 or is it EA’s vision cause of the market created by COD? No. Not feeling the squid, they look too much like squid😀😀 ههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه Also not much else to play, I understand why content creators went there also. Go where the views are and it’s a good BR. But Dice didn’t even create Firestorm and couldn’t make a functioning multiplayer. Now asking them to make both? i wanna shove a huge squid in my mouth and make stupid jokes with you :'((( “I think I’ll have the squid for dinner tonight…”Squid Squad - Metalopod (Bragat Localisation) Thank you again Squid ❤️ Imagine not dating the chad robot Metal Sonic I just want it to be as fun as BF1 was and still is!! Well PRE launch no, but as soon as the first early access is available, it's fair game. It's exposed to the light at that point.Squidward is actually not a squid. He's an octopus. Akane told me and that sounds like super important info. ありがとうございます！ BIG OOF i dare you to look up squid and find a cute one Why are people who used to play bf playing cod now? Because the br is free and it’s cross platform the community is huge now a good br is a marketing toolPizza? Only if it has squids on it! One Long Pair Of Spice Victoria Beckham Squid Do The (Melanie) Chisholm Who do you think manages the account? meanwhile me: hi george why is a group of squids not called a squad??? Battlefield isn’t COD, And I can see the lure of a BR but In my opinion Dice should focus on the Multiplayer experience..

(Jam Session) (Alaba-K'abeena Localisation) Lmao they'll fail regardless. Whoever's in charge nowadays could not pump out another BF3 or BF1. The execs got their heads too far up EA's ass.how in the fuck yall think squidward was an octopus 😭😭 his name...is literally.....squid....ward haaaa? ano yon? hahahahahaha If they had just done what they had done with Dina and Ellie’s sex scene then it wouldn’t have been as memorable, for lack of a better word, and it wouldn’t have forced you to confront Abbys decision in the same brutal way that showing the sex scene does. Multi-Talented GothAlexxis asked me, “are squids smart too?” I said, “i don’t know, but they taste good.” She gave me a look like she couldn’t stand my ass! 😂🤷🏼‍♀️ They force you to watch this sex scene because they don’t want to let you shy away from the fact that Owen is cheating on his pregnant girlfriend, and Abby is willingly participating.I don’t know where to buy dried squid here in Vienna. I tried several Asian supermarkets. I want dried squid. Help. Mmm yeah they did whatever they wanted and it didnt work disappointment after disappointment with the past 3 games. The game wants you to watch that uncomfortable scene and it doesn’t let you shy away from it by merely implying it or cutting away too soon, bc just like how it makes you watch Ellie torture people in order to show you the severity of her actions, (cont.) Lol this is great. Always calling pickups ‘squids’ from now on Also the character manny was not Neil so calling him a “self-insert” is a categorical lie. And as for the Abby sex scene, as painful as it was to watch, there’s good reason for it being there: Twin squids lol "Everyone bought it" The sales was so bad that it only took about 14 days (If I remember correctly) to cut the price in half. And still after the price cut it sold way below the estimate. Reminds me of fighting a squid with a laser, well done!True friendship comes from the heart, not an electric squid to the face. Please explain what you mean by “the Luke Skywalker treatment” bc I just clearly explain why Joel’s death WASN’T Luke Skywalker treatment. You seem very intent on claiming that it is so please explain what you mean. Saying the phrase over and over doesn’t make you right.①Am I interrupting? -No. 訳:お邪魔ですか? - いいえ ②Go on. 訳:続けて ③Should I? 訳:そうしたほうがいい? ④I ordered shrimp, not squid. 訳:イカではなくエビを頼んだのですが Ooooo I love it🤩🙈Squid Sisters - Spicy Calamari Inkantation (Bangala Localisation) What we don't see is techno the squid Mr assault rifle Sorry what? BF1 is actually phenomenal on an aesthetic and gameplay level. I get that historical and curveballs bf games (hardline) are not everyone's cup of tea, which is what you're referring to maybe. Omg this is amazing😱😊 Squid ''Welp it was nice to meet you. But I need to catch up with the human. So Bye!'' *he jumped into the pool and started running in it, trying to get to the exit, he didn't care about anything in the pool at all, leaving him as a perfect target for anything to transfur him* imma squishy squishy squid 🦑 im eh on the pencils bc pointy toys dont agree with me, but holy shit, id kill a man for those super bright lava lamp squids Calm down with the deleting of spelling mistakes quick draw. I’ve been called many things but cutes not one of them sadly I’m married so itd never work out Who is she?🔥🤪😍 Thanks for saying that, Westie. Gotta call it like how it is, no beating around the bush or justify it in anyway. Dice screwed up, on to the next battlefield. Hii, my favorite color is blue, my favorite animal the giant squid, my favorite group the bts, she / her You’re cute kid Wait what is that squid? Don't get me wrong, I'm a squid, my salt tanks are depleted. So I feel that deeply. That said... the feeling of KC lefties is camaraderie I only found in one part of the Navy. So it satisfies for now. Pretty well sir, I’m assuming the use of a meme means you have no intellectual input to this debate so I’ll just sit here with my tea 玉…がいっぱい… Time to sit some kids down on the naughty step and give them some honesty. If you think you can produce an award winning franchise, crack on start a company and leave dice to rebuild a dented one ✌️ Remember the faces of the others in the studio after you played the clip 😂hello i want to go to vidcon for the specific purpose of hugging oh and MPIOP and thomas ig and really all of my moots and the squid squad and chaos and- Productive and fun! Hope your day continues to be swell! I'm doing OK, at work, lots to do Let's hope you're right then "Well sir," said the waiter, "it just shows...... That Hans that do dishes, can be soft as Gervais, with mild green, hairy lip squid!" さきちゃんにあいたくなっちゃぁたんぽ The dishwasher wielded a huge rolling pin and was just about to bludgeon the little green squid with the hairy lip when it cringed back and gave a little cry. "I am sorry sir, I just cannot kill the squid" Hans admitted, his lower lip trembling. "This is Hans, the dishwasher. Hans kill that little green squid with the hairy lip!" Gervais is touched, and admitted that he hadn't the heart to kill the squid. "Not to worry" says the waiter, and called out "Hans!!" at which an enormous German bloke came out of the kitchen. "Sir", said the waiter, A little French chef appeared with a large knife, the waiter instructed the chef to kill the little green squid with the hairy lip. Gervais was just about to slice at the poor squid when he noticed a tear running down its face. "I'll have the little green squid with the hairy lip, please" said the man. "An excellent choice, they have a delicate, mild flavour." replied the waiter and called out "Gervais!" 😂😂😂😂😂😂 LOOOL that's fantastic. For us it would be "You stab this squid/crawfish/rat. What's the order of structures?" hahaonce i was watching a squid kid stream and my brother (was totally his fault) knocked over my glass full of water all over my books and everything and i just cried for a good 20 minutes while watching his stream What is wrong with having LGBT characters/relationships in games? No much like a child with its favourite toy isn’t possessive no your not are you That’s ridiculous. Nobody is being possessive. People are being passionate. Fans want the game to be successful so they’re vocal. Of course, we explored more space than we did our own oceans. If the kraken is real (which there are giant squids being found that’s up to 50ft and more) then mermaids can exist too The arm, the dragging mechanism, the fully modifiable tanks and dragging attachments That's EAs fault though, DICE and other studios are stretched out thin and EA doesn't give a shit Gmorning squid ❤️ I hope you’ll have a good day/sleep!! And thank you I think it’s beautiful too 😳hmmm no new event i thnk everything is set to only end by the 27th, but the new package deal is for seasalt cookie so i think he's getting a part on smth soon.... still no squid ink cookie event tho :/ I think maybe it’s because this one went straight to DVD? I don’t think Disney had many previews/promotions for it on their “DVD previews” section on DVD either. I liked this one too, and the Safari bonus game they had on the special edition! Yeah there's people's opinions but there's also the mass exodus of devs and a massive amount of bad decisions. I think that if they would've had a solid game to begin with they wouldn't have been so quick to "change everything". I used to keep misreading this meme as "Draw The Squid" - my pictures always came out as some sort of squid wriggling its tentacles into the poses. A free BR which not only has cross play but encourages it is a must. COD as gone from a huge franchise to astronomical just by doing this and has a few million extra guaranteed sales of 2020 now What? There were 4 different TTK's in a 2 or 3 months time period. 😂 I can’t be your friend anymore if you thought that big nosed fuck was a squid. Bucket buddies qwq💖😭💖 I watched 1 1/2 a lot, too. I loved the Meerkat Tunnel song 😂 this whole movie was just full of good fluff! Yes! it was quite spooky! XD A haunted aquarium is another good idea for a story, though. Ghost jellyfish, vampire squid, and zombie sharks, oh my! Who else’s game was it then? The identity cris was fully caused by so called “core players” getting but hurt over a teaser trailer "pretending that the potato war is over just so squid slows down production" /jYOU'RE A KID NOW YOU'RE A SQUID NOW Y O U ' R E A K I D Y O U ' R E A S Q U I D Y O U ' R E A K I D Y O U ' R E A S Q U I D Y O U ' R E A K I Yup, give the devs the freedom they need to produce something we’ll love and play! Don’t get all possessive i LOVE spicity!! their dry pots and sizzling squid and p much all their dishes are DELISH Obviously America. If they do ask for community help ,it should be a lot of people from across the world to give feedback on all aspects,does it work 😅 as my South African perspective is different to others ,it would give a rounded conclusion and not one narrative Also sign a NDA😂 Good evening gorgeous Basil glad you are in the cool. It took a while and we saw the squid 🦑 by you. Hope you have a lovely evening hugs 🤗 for mummy Don't worry. The dems rejected her and will do it again squid says no ... ''Did it had brownish hair and Black-like eyes? Oh God I really need to train my memory so I don't forget things'' The difference is that I lost all trust in DICE Cool story bro いやいやいやいや、キルもとれんしハイプレも撃たんし私が最低でした💦💦😓 今度はもうちょっとまともに動ける武器持ちます💦 Hardline followed BF3 while BF5 is a fucking boomer game He’s got the head of an octopus lol not a damn squid....google it 😂🤣😂 Well said,although I do hope for a br. But you like hardline. I mean not gonna lie for different reasons I do agree with you. I think they should do an Apex Legends type of release and give it to us the day it comes out. Let the game sink or swim on its own I really feel sorry if you think that it "threatens" all of gaming. Must be hard for you lol It needs community influence,and some of us just need to sign a little piece of paper called an NDA.. simple .  Nah that sounds sick tho, the vid I'm watching rn is the guy looking for mud crabs but I like this guy's lobster and squid videos a lot too 足引っ張ってすみません💦💦💦💦 Are y’all still goin '' He's my friend. The last time I saw it he was a human... Have you seen him?...'' im curious to see what happens if i tweet a squid lets try it out Squid, Trippmo, and Carptain were playing commander I know what you're saying man, my point is that with the inner struggles DICE and EA has been having I don't really know if BFV would've been that much different even if they had zero input from anyone. She has one cleaning her gaffe..and her fanny for a few extra squids How did they make a u turn exactly? Everything that was in the trailer is in the game too now. It just took a year and a half to come. Except for the arm. I think what we got at launch is just what they had, what we'd have gotten even without backlash. Frankly, I think that there is too much engagement with the player community. All this does is create a sense of entitlement which generates demands on the developers that end up destroying the intended vision in favor of placating cry babies demanding their I Win! meta.  😂 I'm kinda in agreement with this they clearly did a hard turn and imho lost course and drive. I wish we could avoid the rampant speculation and cries of don't do this, do that. Just stop trying to capture old games again the past is the past let new things happen. Facts. This is a terrible take thinking DICE know all best 😅 DICE desperately needs the feedback. They just choose to 90% of the time to ignore it and do what they think is best. Peace prize is an Orwellian Order of Merit He’s an octopus lol squids got pointy ass heads Dude you're giving DICE entirely way too much credit. Missing a squid 🦑 icon before that eye buddy ;) Wait....so.....squid is an octopus right??????? 😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Yh because DICE knows best.... *cough* BFV ttk changes 🤔 Some how I think the ping pong ball will be incorporated into Rangers lore like squid for Detroit or rats for Florida. 🤔 Yikes! Zero influence? So we get another "lesser known battles of________" BFV clearly had an identity crisis and that wasn't because of us. Lol remember BFV when everyone told DICE how to do WW2 and they did the complete opposite? Yeah, let's not say anything at all this time so they can take the wrong decisions again You like the baby squid? Omgggg i'm so happy for u squid!! This is good news!!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😍😍😍😍 me next timemy stomach just made a noise that sounded suspiciously like squid wars walking"Your feral mom is worse than a racist, deranged squid." is worth 11 points. And as for the people who complain that we should have gotten to see Joel more before his death, in order to make the moment more powerful, have you ever considered that you were SUPPOSED to feel as if Joel had been taken from you before you got the chance to reconnect with him??I battled a giant squid and now I'm climbing a tree Joel died as a result of his actions and he knew it. Luke died for literally no reason at all. As a Jedi his death didn’t even have any relevance to the plot bc he just came back as a force ghost when they needed him. Joel’s death had major impact on the plot.  When I say Joel deserved to die, I don’t mean I wanted him to die, I love Joel, but you can’t deny that killing an entire military base and some innocent doctors and dooming the entire human race to die isn’t grounds for being killed. Joel did not have Luke Skywalker treatment at all. Luke was killed randomly for no clear reason and without even a clear cause of death. He didn’t do anything that would have made him deserve to die or anything. He literally just died. thank god. plus i just read the techno x squid kid so my will to live is 📉 i couldn't handle another Its them jammin! angry squid the matcha cookies looked so good!! but also watching selena handle the squid in the second episode had me laughing so hard 😭  Don't forget that in Napoli is very famous the "frittura di paranza". Means they fry all the little fishes left in the net (paranza is the name of a typical boat used for fishing). But some also add some squids and little octopus 😋 This is a bad take. BFV was the game that DICE, openly said they ‘wanted to make’. Yes, negative feedback changed a fair bit, but DICE also openly mocked player criticism too. BFV was defined by developer ignorance, game breaking issues, bland content, and broken promises. sorry lupaaa haha! the one that i went ada more than just beef la, ade chicken, duck, squid, prawns, fish, lamb, all roasted in skewers. not sure experience sama ke tak thoo huhu. tapi tulaa, brazilian flavors tak ngam la dengan tekak aku haha No As I've stated, they just look credible. It's a really interesting subject. It might not be a squid, it was a guess. But I hope you find out. SqUID GORL DRESS HHH the particles that come out when an squid inks on you or rain :) Nigga ...... a squid 😂 how dare- No, not a squid. The soft parts of animals are rarely fossilised, and this is too vague in shape for that. squid And you know these leaks are 100% real?I'm a squid kid The 'so called professionals' can't even make a working party system, where friends can join to play as a squad!ScHoOl oF SqUiD 🦑 •George 2020 BFV !? The game made with 0 outside influence? Their core gameplay is awful. Their vision lacks clarity. Their foundation to build upon is missing. Their post-launch content plans are a joke. They need as much feedback as possible. Fans have run out of goodwill patience. if y'all really think squidward looks like a squid yall dumb ash I'm telling him he'll look stupid for being agressive about it. ☠️ That would look as if he's super confident over something he really couldn't possibly know. No.a SCHOOL of SQUID Back to whining are We? I know just think its funny you telling people that theyll look stupid if their wrong, and how easily that could backfire on you lol. Woo hoo Basil. Enjoy the garden. We can spot the colossal squid😹 Enjoy yourself sweetie 💙😽 LMAO he’s a squid... SQUIDward😹😹 Small squid?I’m craving some fresh squid. I really need a sugar mama to send me food😭🥺🐙 Absolutely, personally I think everybody should remember BFV. Keep an open mind, don't listen to marketing and judge the game fairly. But let's be real...once the new game comes out, people will rave about how great BFV was! You still here? Didn't you sign out almost an hour ago? Go watch Paw Patrol or something kid. 😂 ... And hope EA leave them free... But it's utopical. Your like that cause your 2 sides . So you just go off emotion more heavily. Virgo is structural and even if it works for you , their way is theirs. They are pretty good all around yet have a hard time admitting when wrong. Even if they know they won’t tell until its obvious Well positive was the wrong word choice. More so just unconcerned, like the next game is magically going to be great, that’s what I have an issue with. Everyone should be concerned. You have to be realistic imo. Yes... But no. If fans (cause all of us are Fans☝️) keep hoping/arguing bout bf6 if because we care about the game and we HOPE the next one will literally kick ass. Bfv was an awfull experiment and EA knows. So the real hope is: let Dice do what they do best... Exactly twitter is so fucking toxic it’s almost as bad as reddit the people that are on here just won’t to kill someone that has a different opinion the squid mens floating on the toilet💖 whAt hAppened 😅?? lmfaoooooo it dont help that squid is in his name 😂😂😂😂😂 NO PLS....SQUID GUYS....SQUID 😔😔😔💦💦KDJ.... I’ve really wanted to do some before!! Tbh the first handmade plush I ever got was a squid loosely based off of it :) LMFAOi aint seen the bro josen in a grip yeah ima pull up on the squid 黙れ だれが？ shut up julezmon fan You need those English classes ASAP! 😬 To be fair BFV improved when it came to listening to the players who stump up their hard earned money for their product. The greatest explanation of BFV is that, its an alternative universe in which, the major powers hired mercenaries and provided them with the gear and vehicles and let them customize it to their liking, that's the best explanation imo Shut up bot Okay kid you are “Vary” annoying you said you’d leave like 3 times don’t you have like art class on Zoom or something in a few minutes? There's so many Battlefield channels out there now that I have unsubbed from and just don't talk to because they spew negativity. Nothing is ever good enough. I don't have time for that rubbish. Don't shill, but don't be an entitled wanker either. Gay people are just people. The gay stereotype isn't realistic. What was forced about Ellie's first kiss/ relationship with Dina? ok 5head 😭 Good for you Who’s talkin’ about a Robocop skin? We know there's a chance it isn't true. It just seems legit. That's the point. ☠️ JoJos Bizarre Adventure Dragon Maid Tower of God Re:Zero Princess Connect My Next Life as a Villainess Laid Back Camp Keep Your Hand Off Eizouken Zombieland Saga Hinamatsuri Squid Girl Konohana Kitan Keijo ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) New Game Restaurant to Another World Who said it was I'm sure that the marketing had a great deal in battlefield V's failure, together with the complete lack of sense when dealing with the backlash Of course you're 13. ☠️ 4chan, was shared a while ago No. 😂 You'd love that. ☠️ I'm not triggered like you were when joining this conversation. 😂 Yea you were wrong. Just go. You're embarrassing yourself. 😂Early Ranma 1/2: pensive slow relationship drama with gender fuckery and occasional goofy sight gags Late Ranma 1/2: this is the 800th fiancé of Ranma's, Ranma's grandpa sold him to her dad for 3 takoyaki, her weapon is a giant takoyaki pan, and she turns into a giant squid Idk I never played it because I don’t have an VR Headset but OMG HALF LIFE 3 GOT TEASED IN THE END My opinion It ended up the way it did because of the community's reaction to the trailer. Sure part of the reason it didn't end up good was because of bugs and stuff but if the community's opinion had no effect on the game then we should be seeing artificial limbs in-game.🤔 Looks like it mate. I don’t get it at all In terms of innovation. Half-Life Alyx would be the game of the year. freegay- things happen. The location of this nightmare is in a submarine more like a port for submarines and I am working in this port and a gigantic squid just keeps on entering the port in destroying everything that I've worked for and everything that I love. And I don't know why I- To me there's a difference between being a positive person on YouTube and completely shilling for a company. Silver lining and all that. I don't enjoy watching "hate" videos, why bother? It's just one person shouting on the internet, I don't care enough to watch. we, too, love it when the blue air squid deposits their blue arrows into our lungs *and* our soil! I don't see a problem with being optimistic, but I think we absolutely should. They botched the launch and support for the game.the dono abt the squids, where u seeing squids ...It seems we're reaching the point where the human mind simply cannot handle any more squid-related info. But here you are stillthere’s been a smell in my brothers room so rancid he hasn’t been able to sleep in there for weeks.This morning he yells from downstairs and goes “i found the smell source! it’s squid in my backpack from when i went fishing!” He went fishing a month ago... and yaked this morning Man you really showed us. I’m really sad now. 腕立て不問把握です You’re the one who like that terrible squid fart song called let me hear you say Which has little to no proof, until it comes out.there’s something abt squid partying and still winning that just brings me ultimate joy Because based on some of design decisions in BFV, it is warranted this is beautiful ! I-Your screen name is the Squid emoji. I drop a Dad Joke about you being a Kraken. You don’t know what a Kraken is. 🙃 DO YOU KNOW WHAT A LEAK IS? That is not confirmed. They might accept it. Couldn’t agree more Well that goes without saying lol. I’m just particularly tired of people, particularly content creators with lots of reach, sitting here acting all positive and unconcerned. Nah, it’s time to put the hammer down. You want another content cancelled game? I sure don’t. Nobody does I havent seen a pay packet big enough to get my opinion. Either of you boys get yours yet? I started this thread What song or track won you over? GG! honestly I never experienced it, like if i’m hanging out w my close friends and we just keep silent it will be awkward and i’m gonna be anxious as hell No one cares, be decent But... His name... Is squid...ward... 100% agree with you. But, my point isn't that we should sit there idle, twiddling our thumbs, being ok with every decision made. Instead, we should voice concern and be critical. But the hate train that struck BFV...with death threats etc... that's just going too far. No, you should literally never trust DICE SWE. If it was DICE LA, different story. You can’t just accept failure. Fact is, DICE SWE has been a proven failure, and they’re in full control of the next BF game. The only thing we can hope for is EA giving them more time. So delusional. Only influence we had by hating on the trailer was they started hiring people to make better trailers for a shitty game after that lol. If they listened to their community the game could have been saved. LMAO I can spot . . . 1. A colossal Squid 2. A Furrocious Lion I don’t think the English language is his first. The lack of punctuation is a good hint. I think he’s mad about something? Has he looked in his offshore bank accounts? That's where I look when I find myself a few billion squids short. Here you are, bein’ one again. There’s no need to tell anyone to shut up, if you can’t have a decent conversation, then don’t interact? BFV’s trailer was disliked spammed into oblivion... Everyone bought it tho. EA got their Don’t buy the game and see how much the community influence grows 😉 Instead it's just reusing the Sun and Moon engine, but with HD models. Plus they already dipped there toes in with Let's Go. Sword and Shield would definitely be the time to bring something big. Maybe not pushing the system big, but something amazing. みんな違ってみんなかわいいですね😌 I guess the question is does Dice want to focus on a BR or does EA want Dice to focus on a BR? Educated feminist are aware that men suffer and argue that women face oppression from Men, capitalism and societal expectations of their gender. I'm not saying push to its limits I'm saying that they should at least try. 3DS power compared to Switch Power is N64 compared to Switch. That's like saying and Mario 64 pushes the N64's limits. They could've at the very least made the render distance better. Else the game might've had good gameplay  So just sit there and be nice all the time? Listen, I get your point, but the time for being Mr Nice Community is over. BF6 is it. If BF6 is bad, it’s over. BF has been run into the ground past BF4, and it’s time to make a high quality, industry competitive, BF game. Thank you Oh, I'll have to check if I still have a double squid plush, I did end up getting both of those plushes but I wouldn't mind doubles Right!? I was shocked when I put them next to each other. I didn't think it was that close. Still hot here as well alrhough we’ve had some rain. The squid is cute 😚 I'm not smart, I just try and think before I reply. Unlike a lot of the bullshit that is smeared all over this website...jamie bring back murdocs squid tattoo Yeah, that's why I think BFV went the way it did, mainly because people complained about what was in the trailer. That energy needs to be bottled 🤩💚🤟 THAT’S FROM THE ORIGINAL SERIES aaaaah ty emmi! :] You’re on about influence. We have no fucking influence. EA and DICE are going to do whatever they want to do. How long have we been complaining about anti cheat, RSP, team balance, ect? Nothing gets done. They don’t care. What's that test called again? Congrats buddy! 🙌 勢ぞろい！！ こうしてみると圧巻だなOh, and there will be one rule: No Squid-bagging or Octo-bagging; just 'Booyah' instead Pledge doesn't make much difference unless you are a whale pool owner.

Lag because the games are too intense. That's why handhelds are for smaller games. Because smaller games run easier. Also powerful? 3DS? No. Not even close. My take: The internet always wants something, but it is never satisfied. What is said online 100% impacts game development and the devs personally. Online chatter is made up of a vocal minority. GC's Forums take too much credit for decision making. We aren't game devs. Hehehe Pokémon go brrrrr 3D World doesn't. 3D Land was made for handhelds. 3D World stays basically the same, but on a Home Console. Odyssey however makes huge changes to 3D Mario that makes it an amazing new game. SwoShi doesn't bring enough changes to feel like it should be on the Switch. I could see GoT win in the category best soundtrack Yeah let's just forget about the fact that EA and DICE were stubborn about BFV, how good it turned out! There's entirely different points to them. Handhelds are for smaller games. And X and Y still had many changes. Like a jump to 3D. Mario Kart Super Circuit, DS, and 7 are all very similar, while Double Dash, Wii, and 8 are what changed things. It's why 3D Land works and... Aren’t they going to be doing that anyway? They changed the TTK twice against the entire communities wishes, and you think we have influence? LOL So people should just keep quiet and cross their fingers? How about when 128 player maps are mentioned and people are afraid the servers won’t be filled...and with the abysmal team balancer of V...you’re right, we shouldn’t say anything. No I think I picked up on both of your points (Cams was cheeky but true), just not at the same time. And the gameplay is still equally as trash as it was before, wish I did have some influence about it .. This story... I just... 😪😪 nothing improved with the Switch. You are supposed to criticize things companies make. It will make them better successes if they follow through."You will need to be able to memorize important concepts in your life... You will struggle with them, like wrestling a squid, and then one day you will understand it. All that work memorizing the basics pays off big later." - Why does Squid Girl have a 5 star rating on Crunchyroll Bro what lol Most people BBND and not, criticize Sword and Shield. It's on a home console. People want change. It was easier to ignore when it still on a handheld. Imagine if when Nintendo released the Wii U, people said that others should be glad we were getting an HD home console, and... Looks like spicy squid to me. More like a damp squid I think I see. There’s two different influences we’re talking about. Yes, I’m pretty onboard with that. Are you sure?Thank you!I'm so happy for you! In large part I do agree with you Squidyboi. The more conjecture and “you better not!” Or “you better!” Isn’t going to help them release a product. The extra year, though, should. In theory. but fr i don’t remember the exacr name for the website but it’s something w squid?? it has photoshop, ae and whatever i got ae from theredjeeta: hello! squid: bbbbwbhdhsjlllluurgggg woomy I think though even if they didn't U-turn the game would have flopped. Doomed from the moment that reveal trailer started playing 😔 Still not sure who thought "WW2 but without anything WW2 about it" was going to catch on 😬 I never disagree with you, but BFV was not really a success. There is so much access to people, feedback, data etc, in 2020. I hope they do listen. Hell, COD is doing something right—skins customization proves everyone is spending just to look cool on a crap game.I try not to make things awkward but out of know where I start talkin bout aliens and squids she still gave me her number but come on there’s no need Maybe DICE should get ahead of the curve and give folks information. 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️ The silence on development will not be beneficial for them. I felt it dude. I chortled on my protein shake. I mean i will still walk with it and eat a two chee shrimp. But that lobster and squid is sure k.o thing. YOU KNOW IM A SQUID KID BUT DO YOU NOW IBALLISTICSQUIF?!2): Subtle burn not so subtle? 😂 Lost all credibility in that tweet by adding the word criticize at the end as if you aren't supposed to criticize things. No, no. The GameChangers ruined it. 🙃I hope made some spaghetti today! 0w0 I think the public believe DICE failed really hard with BFV and they have a lot to make up for this time around 😔 Well it normally serves it's purpose as a racing car, so I guess its a transformer? So why tweet this tweet? Gogo squid!!! By far!! Skate in love if ur very very bored I enjoyed the first half but then idk Is...is its final form an actual 747? A giant squid would be a better prez than trump, and you should be ashamed to defend someone like him...unless you are like him. I need to beat Ghost so I cannot comment on story stuff. My only vote against LOUII is specifically because photo mode doesn't top Tsushima's photo mode. And Game of the Year should succeed in all aspects. Otherwise I think its a toss up! Well it’s subjective and the colour is awful IMO.I just need vampire squid and then I have all the sea creatures available this month ✨ BFV was made with zero outside influence as well 😬 You'll have cracked eye sight, meaning you'll be extra cracked at squid shoot trying clothes simulator Ha, been building this boy up bit by bit for a long time now. It has mostly reached its final form! 👆 the ones that i will never ever use are the crying/laughing ones 😋 It’s public land, squid. DANCE POTATO BOYWe confused and amused quite a lot of people, but thankfully mostly at a safe distance, and it was great to see what everyone had come up with! The pigeon had great head wobble action and hilarious tiny hands, the dragon could blow bubbles, and the squid was so elegant 🤩 mac. sometimes cable frays and i need to lay out 70 squid every few years fax 😂 my taste is bad so take with a grain of salt but: sound of your heart, pretty proofreader, go go squid I’d love to see Ermac return They are ❤️❤️❤️ Imagine how I feel as a ermac/reptile fan LMAO. Check the replies in ANY of tweets. You will see people are literally everywhere demanding this fighter. Even if the post has nothing to do with MK. I don’t understand why you all are so obsessed with a Kitana Clone. Literally all she is. there’s something about a squid that gives me horse energy A rotten potato squid 相性良き嬉しい🥰すいみんに尽くしていくぅ!!!What do you call a baby squid in filipino? .....pst 🦑 You are right, netherrealm could very well go ahead and Doctor up some “Mileena” to please the fans but it would probably come to fruition as a rushed spawn/robocop situation. Fans won’t be happy either way. Bunch of people who think Ed Boon and NRS work for them. thanks trumpet emoji on main (junebugz) pumpkin emoji lemon emoji squid emoji ladybug emoji Lol you wish squid kid 😤 You're right, but I'm not understanding why you guys are so pressed when it comes to us asking for Mileena. Like, shes literally the equivalent of what Reptile/ermac are to sub zero or scorpion. She can sit out for a game. Anyone remember being able to play as Jade in MKX? I don’t. We'll see. Don't be so confident my dude. 👀 You have no idea what Netherrealm has up their sleeves I'm just saying. Squids got 8 arms They don't want Mileena. They probably got tossed by her in Mkx. 😂 I'm not even a fan of her but I won't deny the leak is looking credible. That's all I'm saying. The chances of her being included in the mk11 roster are slim to none. Kitana has her sai as well as a bunch of her moves, hell, even a brutality of hers in a Mileena mkx fatality. Also - Shes included in Kitanas friendship. It just wouldn’t work. But fr looking like fried squid, dry as a chip.So im pissed because I always thought Squidward was an octopus but always wondered why the fuck he don’t have 8 legs I JUST FOUND OUT THIS NIGGA A DAMN SQUID I FEEL SOOO SLOW RN😂😂😂😂😂 If your wrong you do know that you'll never hear the end of it as well, it goes both ways lol. But, why does it affect you? Why are you guys so upset that we are asking for a character? We aren't attacking anyone, so why? u justin...justin.......yorkshire biggest county...gods country.....ben white is leeds he will be coming home............greedy/small selling club/ brighton will go down this season.........£30 million squid could save you bielsa made him much better motSquid Squad - Now or Never!

Why don't you grow up. 😂 Well to be honest I like adding it to my homemade fish cakes, they are just scrummy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Yes! Yes! YES! 無理で死 Dude....if she does end up in the game... you'd make yourself look foolish with those comments. I'm just saying. Obviously she's not confirmed but there is a chance.Tried to trade calamari for goods and services, but most places have strict policies against squid pro quo. ど底辺たまんご涙目 A squid smh Because it’s relentless dude. These fools never shut up and think for some reason mileena will be in this game. Yeah, she’s a versatile character that has had many appearances in the franchise. I just don’t know why so many people are obsessed or mad that she’s not included. はい！💕💕💕 Has to be Grilled Salmon with new potatoes and broccoli! 😋 I thought the plm was attached to the squid for a sec クソビッチ Thanks for the shoutout, Squid!!
