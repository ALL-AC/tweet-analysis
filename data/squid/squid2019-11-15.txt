Stopped playing as much when online became paid though because the service didn't improve the connection at all. Squids 🐙🐙🐙 I meant that I don’t think Animal Crossing could be delayed without facing major backlash. I don’t really dislike the idea behind Splatoon, I just know after watching like 10 hours of gameplay that it isn’t for me But what of that disaster is about you and the squid. In order for them to survive, they need to get rid of you and those other two beauties. I could have another car with the amount i spend Hot take: I think it's fine if the dex doesn't return, cos it puts more pressure on them to actually improve on the games overall. I know people are cutting them slack now, but if the next gen barely improves without the dex I think most older fans will drop the games.Squid Sisters - Ink Me Up (Afro-Seminole Creole Localisation) I LOVE Splatoon xDLo que más extrañare de los Cabos será el squid roe 😂 They faced backlash for delaying lol. Bowser had to make a statement about crunch to mitigate it, and even still some people were pissed. Naah splatoon is a lot of fun, pretty unique take on shooters, with loveable characters that nintendo are known for. please leave him alone he’s just a poor squid kidLaughing Squid: Build the collaborative networks that will make the world safer from . + to go  Stupid squid Indirectly, there are folks who have. Traded it from game to game until they got it to modern. A couple of the games have convoluted ways of going about it, but yes. Indirectly, folks have done it Changing his name to Im_a_sad_squid At work rn bum Wow Pokemon Sword and Shield sucks! Look at the quality! This Pokemon looks ugly! Wtf was game freak thinking? 😤 Not directly no. ワクワクが止まらねーぜ！ Animal Crossing is the most anticipated Switch release since BotW, I don’t think they could delay it without significant backlash. I won’t really comment on Splatoon bc I just think it’s an E-rated, wannabe Gears of WarFood? We're talking about space exploration here! You could see something most squids never get to. And you want to stay on Earth and eat chips?! I want my realtor to be Scott I find it funny when you get asked “Yo are you the real Highdistortion?”, “Are you really HighDistortion?” Etc. Keep slaying them squids HD! Cos ultimately investors are more important. And unfortunately pokemon doesn't need its fans to succeed. No se como reaccionar ante eso '--------' Splatoon 2 was rushed with crucial story content that should have been in the base game added later as 20 dollar dlc. Animal crossing could be delayed cos pokemon comes out this month and is enough to sell switches during the holiday. Ashe just says “ILY Jesse” and when she kills Lucio she says “The squid could use more seasoning” she also got shafted last 2 events she didn’t even get voice lines so I cried. Blizz needs to put the voice interactions in place to establish lore.I was recommended a band called Squid. They released their EP and damn, it's good!This dude has like eight nicknames.... Squiggerina Squiggert Squigbert squiggit Squignatious Squigglit Squirgle Squiggins Squid Squigglesworth 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 うっほほー☝(☣౪☣)☝やばいっすな…！ 近いですね…！ But what I don’t get is why it’s looked down upon for Pokémon fans to expect a good game when literally every other Nintendo fanbase is allowed to make those demands. Why cater to the niche fanbase of Metroid and then not cater to the hardcore fans of Pokémon? 💀💀💀im not the only one who wanna die after touching the train with any part of my body 😂 That's what I mean, Nintendo is strategic on what they delay and what they rush. Examples BOTW was delayed to use to sell the switch. Metroid was delayed because that game has a niche fanbase so it HAS to be amazing, they don't want to have anothet star fox zero. That is an indication of a problem because you take such good care of your gear I sort of hate to touch your gear because I might break it. So if you are breaking stuff, it is easy to break. Fyi, got classic base stations at the ready for you if you get in a jam. 😂🤣😂😂 I get what you’re saying about Nintendo also being liable, but it’s not like they forced the team working on Odyssey or BotW to rush the games to meet release deadlines, the biggest issue is that they’re using SwSh to promote the Switch Lite which really has no other purpose Uh, she lost twice. There is no 3rd charm with her. We need someone who can race the track with Trump and call him out like the squid he is!28. I am most comfortable around my bff squid.

Anyway, have fun waiting for high tide." With an evil chuckle, he starts walking away as seawater starts hitting the squid in the face And in a flash, of light, the two find themselves on a beach, as he is holding up a shovel. In a blur of motion, he already has a squid girl sized hole by the point where the tides rise, as he proceeds to drop the squid in the hole and bury her, so only her head is exposed. Suddenly the squid goes pale backing up, until she ended up back against the wall. ❝Uh-oh...
