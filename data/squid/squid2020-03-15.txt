RightImagine being a bigger squid than Drake 反抗期ですか？ 全く困ったものです、やれやれ✋ Nice hair Pretty sure a heart condition doesn't impair your ability to lead a country like dementia doesgulp that squid The primary isn’t the general, and biden won’t be able then to be sheltered by a bubble of positive media coverage, which studies have shown is extremely biased against sanders it's unfortunate that you feel that way, since he will lose very badly to trump or just wander off into the woods one night before the general いつまで子供でいる気ですか？ 早く大人になりなさい I’ll be sorry?

Also imagine the video above played three weeks straight before the election, he is a uniquely weak candidate Two million people get stents a year."BRING ME BERT" I CANT BELIEVE WE HAVE BERT THE SQUID IN LA BY NIGHT TOO OMGGGGG JKDSBGJKERBGJKER BRYAN I FCANT Yes a heart attack is totally normal 眠れた？ 即イカカワ！！！🦑😊🦑 Bernie had a common preventative heart surgery. Biden does not know what year it is. If he is...he's gonna forget ... The report also neglects to mention his subconjunctival hemorrhage, which caused his left eye to fill with blood during a September televised town hall hosted by CNN." ...According to his personal physician, Biden is currently being treated for A-fib, or an irregular heartbeat, high cholesterol, acid reflux From Washington Examiner: "O'Connor also detailed Biden's long history of surgeries and hospital admittance, starting in 1988 when he suffered a cerebral aneurysm. That aneurysm resulted in surgery and a later complication, which nearly cost Biden his life... Bernie premised his whole campaign on the youth vote. Then they didn’t turn out. The youth vote will always be flakey, no matter what decade we are in. おれも会ってみたい(*´Д`)ﾊｧﾊｧ Like a squid, he has many arms. Best squid! 😍 Bernie is older and just had a heart attack. “Bernie doesn’t have a problem appealing to black voters” ... goes on to lose that demographic by like 30 points Tell me what states Bernie won? Fair. i'm being optimistic. Every day Biden exhibits his cognitive decline. Harassing voters, forgetting what decade he's in, forgetting where he is. We're not even halfway through, do you think he's going to make it to July? こわ The ranking is squid - octopus - crab Thank you for informing me of the states that have voted. Tell me, what fraction of the delegates are those? 3-6? More like 2-7. Breyer is no spring chicken.

I’ll be fine no matter who is president. Look. I wish Biden had never entered. But Biden is undoubtedly better than Trump and that should be the MAIN reason to vote for him if he's the nominee. Hell, RBG is reason enough. She won't make it 4 more years and then Trump replaces her and we have a 3-6 court. Hell. No. ？ Yup and guess what? California and Texas have already voted. Florida is up next and Biden is polling at around +30 there. Oh and Bernie got smoked in Michigan, Mississippi, and Missouri. He also lost Washington 何よりもスマホアプリのゆっくりボイスのパチモン感が好きじゃない I’m not the one who said the demographics that matter line. Nice try at deflecting. Spare me your bullshit what do you think is the age of consent in their squid society? おばいろはちゃん！🍡 やってて｢これ光ってるだろうなー｣とは思ってたけど予想以上に出て驚いた!!😳 逃すとこの値段で手に入んないかもよ So black people is not a demographic that matters ? Oh it’s very fucking over. He’s over 100 delegates behind in a system that awards delegates proportionally. There are no winner take all states. The biggest prizes are off the board and Biden is poised to sweep 4 states in convincing fashion. it's march. the convention is in june. Bernie is only 150 delegates behind, only 1700 out of 4700 have been allocated. Biden is not the nominee in any regard.Squid Sisters - Fresh Start (Biatah Localisation) 安いね かろうじて生きてます！！ イカカワ🦑イカカワ🦑イカカワ🦑ダワカワ🦑 エプロン眼鏡、スーツ眼鏡も大好物！🥰🥰 いや死体じゃないです！！ he's not the nominee If Biden is weak then what is Bernie?
