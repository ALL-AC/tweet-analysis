And Beth are aware of this. I'm not sure they'd risk doubling down on making a pure settlement sim ちなみに俺はシコれないけどフォロワーの1人はシコってるらしい It looks like it was built in the same engine as 4, though. And I can't really imagine how a pure settlement sim would work with 4's mechanics, given a large part is contingent on exploration and scavenging. 👏👏👏super article. Infographie enregistrée.

True, but I think if it was a ward/hostage scenario, Jon Arryn would have been working out the details, not Robert. (much like Theon - "you should take his son as a ward" "I don't want that squid fucker!" "give him to Ned then") And all of them are going to fall right back out with gen 8 come next year. If all people are interested in is gen 1, then get an emulator and play gen 1. It's long overdue for GF to leave them behind and forge ahead without wasting the effort of keeping them interested ミッス派さんこんにちは😅🖐️ カルちゃん小麦粉スーハーしたらあかんで（笑） うん、好感度アップ！ Note I said "continue to give kanto special treatment" there has been a ridiculously high amount of special treatment given to specifically gen 1 mon just to keep genwunners and the like interested in the franchise. 自分もさっき｢小さい なみのり｣みたいな感じでググって出てきたんですけどラッコしかいなくてマリルいなかったんで違うかなと思って消しちゃいました Cool but your missing the point that it's not wise to only ever make games for that crowd. The more the can get in the better. As someone else said this was made by another team so development was lost on the newest game. No need to be so hostile to them or anyone tbh. ナイスうう！ 引きを全部もらいますねありがとうございます😎😎😎 I said it makes sense business-wise given the current outside interest in the franchise. For dedicated fans, this is not what was wanted. Not even close On top of that the game gets rid of the grinding. That makes these games more accessible to more people. With that said, this isn't a game for me...but is it really meant to be? Nah. But it may be for my cousins who played the fuck out of Go but not the mainline games.Squid Sisters - Calamari Inkantation (Balantak Localisation) Letpeopleenjoythings.png BIGも引いて五右衛門も引くなんてほんとに引きがいいですね( ˘ω˘ )ツラ ちょいマヌケそうなとことか可愛いですよね！プニプニしたい 笑 フッサフサで気持ち良さそうで…笑 Is it really about "giving kanto special treatment," or is it more firing into the nostalgia that older people have with it, which is what helped blow up Pokemon Go? This can bring more people back into Pokemon, which is good for the franchise. these were made JUST 4 U LMAO This is geared at someone like me who has been wanting to play a Pokémon game but just never bought a handheld since gamebly advance haha. I've not played one fully since red/blue. This game probably tipped me over the edge on a switch haha. ハァァァァツラ(o_o) ウパー好きなんですね(*´∀｀*) その中だとブースターしか好きなのいない 笑 Why you agree it makes sense but still hates it. News flash not every game released has to be curtailed to only you. Don't play it if you don't want to うまい座布団10枚あげるi mean, amybe its just cause i played comp Mk8, but I dont get that salty over Squid game??? My old ass wants this, too! I love the Pokémon RPG and Pokémon Go. We can enjoy both I'll agree that it's a fantastic business decision, but I very strongly disagree franchise-wise. Other than genwunner pandering, there's no reason to continue giving kanto special treatmentAnybody else just sit around watch documentaries?? Like, I can’t tell you much about college algebra but if you ask me about giant squids or the ruins of Puma Punku, I got you‼️😂 did that report about Octupus dna not include other cephalopods? like squids, cuttlefish, and nautilus? are they too of off world dna? 強いね(=^x^=) Outta here genwunner ありがとうございます！ エーフィと冒険したかった…笑 Looks to be Marines though. Dont like to be confused for "the common soldier". 😎😎 Rather swim with squids,damned squid heads. and yet we don't get to battle wild pokemon and its seemingly super simplified for no reason THOUGH IT SHOULD JUST BE A STANDARD REMAKE OF YELLOW BUT ITS JUST POKEMON 2.0 gonna be massively disappointed if I this isn't actually a pokemon game and its go ぼくもそうです(再現できそうにないのは残しますが) I personally think this is gonna be fantastic other than mechanics we don't know about and would you rather have game freak wait 2 years each time they release a new generation if that where the case we would have 11 pokemon regions we need in between games + its a spinoff 最初からしてれば事前登録者ももっと増えたでしょうな、iphoneユーザーも多いし。 伊勢うどん食ってろ(=^ェ^=) たべやすーい！それ、のった！ あとitunesとかでも登録できたのならですね、まあ突破はめでたいことですし後はゲーム内容次第YOU'RE KIN WITH THE SQUID YOU'RE KIN WITH THE SQUID YOU'RE KIN WITH THE SQUID YOU'RE KIN WITH THE SQUID YOU'RE KIN WITH THE SQUID YOU'RE KI やってないよ〜？？？ さすゆずちゃん👍👍👍👍👍👍 （．人．）　おっぱい！おっぱい！UUUUUHHH whoever designed the PONS squid helmets: WHAT THE FUCK BRO いまの状況で考えられるのは、Google playで登録可能にした結果ですかね。 流石にあまりにも早すぎてビビりましたが。 I actually liked Squid Wood おしゃれ。you're a kid now! you're a squid now!

How tiresome is it to think you need to scrub your fantasies clean and justify whatever it is that gets you hot I dunno but funny, but also REALLY painful to look at. I need at least 2 hours of every day to caress Shiro's breast meat on my Shiro daki in the hopes of inducing lactation I simply cannot devote my life to policing the fap thoughts of everyone else on the planet No one cares about anything that happened after the first 151. So stoked for this. カルちゃんなんかやってるな|ω･)！！ They have more than 1 team, so development hours weren't "wasted." Also, for what reason should gen 8 be their main focus? You? Selfish adult gamers? Business-wise and franchise-wise this is actually a smart decision. Lmao what is this gif? 😂😂 手袋もしてるし めっちゃ着込んでるし 妖精は寒さに弱いって 話だからね Exactly そして安定の左上 Oh trust me, I've read their tweets. Doesn't change the fact that this is unneeded and that gen 8 should've been their main focus for this year's release. Development hours did not need to be wasted on this I also just really don't care about what gets people's dicks hard? like so what if it's fetishy? As long as you treat actual people well, I really have zero fucks about what fake shit you're jerking it to. Our brains are weird and find weird shit hot When you're not funny... Hi, my name is Squid... なんでや注射気持ちいいやろi need to give my splatoon oc a name so he can stop just being "my squid" HE DOESN'T LIKE THEM. AT ALL. You miss the point.
