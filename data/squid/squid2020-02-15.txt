Netflix is a membership so not really the same. If you buy a dvd etc you dont own the rights to it. Bigfin squid ÙwÚ ＼(＞ω＜)わふーっ! わふー（＞ω＜）/ 選択肢ミスった僕が悪いです、、、、 However they are still iffy about cutscenes. So again. you buying a game does not mean you can post whatever you want. Games studios arent dicks about it anymore but if they see abuse they have the right to ban and strike etc. You dont even have to go that far back to see this. Nintendo until recently would strike channels for posting cut scenes. They they changed it to just copyright claiming videos. Now recently they allow anyone to post gameplay and wont claim it. giant squid As for the PPV comparison. If you pay for Netflix do you own the content and can do what you want? That is not PPV that is consume as much as you can. Its the same philosophy. たけくんおはよおだべ₍ ᐢ. ̫ .ᐢ ₎！！！ And it wasnt even a copy paste of alan moore's story.

We no longer need licenses because game studios found out that it was free promotion. Technically they could strike everyone who posts their content. Its why Halo was so hard to make videos for years ago. なるほど！隙間時間とかに丁度いいですこれ🥰 No they are not ROFL. You are so lost dude. When youtubers first started the only reason they could make money was because of networks having partnership with game studios that allowed them to make video. You dont purchase a license to the content by buying a game.when can we get more official band art, we had last year where we got ink theory and bottom feeders and it was GREAT i think we still need appearances from wet floor and chirpy chips and heck, squid squad. what are the other members of squid squad up to these days I do want to retract my “all women” statement as mentioned in my previous tweet, that was wrong, but you’re still a squid  がんばりましょ！ あのあぷりいつから始めてます？ これは間違いなく音柱Is Marriage Story just a new Squid and the Whale?
