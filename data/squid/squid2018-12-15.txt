But How?, They are in the Smash Bros Ultimate And appear in the official artwork of the next Splatfest. Sometime people think about very absurd thing. ‼️‼️  逆にどれだと思う？笑squid girl in my boot Centrism reminds me of a vampire squid.I love ! its bad because it rewards skilled play. headshots havent got nerfed a bit. but everyone new or lesser skilled now has to get closer, and shoot more bullets to kill enemys. all i see now are snipers, and some noobs throwing BB's at each other at mid range to amuse the snipers. .... and a calosso squid Look at the furthest potato on the bottom of your plate,, step up two more,, squid words bulbous cranium そろそろ冷たくない雪が降る ttk changes rewards people with good aim. means new players gonna have an even harder time to win a firefight. if you good at aiming to the head, you wont notice anything. but new players get screwed. so stupid this change. Week 2 challenges...do you mean now we all get to see how stupid the revive system. BTW BFV is now the only BF where you can spawn behind an opposing team and knife nearly all of them in the back without anyone knowing what the f is happening. Comeback mechanics is retarded. Who is responsible for that? I wont play until their gone. 思ってることを言った( ᷇࿀ ᷆ ) Bye Squid Hi my name Squid Squid Goads?"OKAY BUT. OKAY. HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE MEGALODON???

After some rough matches of turf, and about two hours spent on training a new squid to the city, he’s taking a small break. Thanks for fucking up the game so i couldnt get the extra overture XP cause you couldnt be fucked to fix anything on time 最近復活したよねその後どうなったかわからないけど👽 わかりみ お疲れっす Also with the ttk as it is now you've made medic a redundant class it was bad enough already now its as much use as a bicycle for a fish. Yours truly a disgruntled battlefield fan That's lovely, just a quick question if the game has an element of attrition to it and we start with less ammo, how for all that's good does it make sense to to increase the ttk, making it harder to get a good kill run going. Stop fixing the good things and not the real problems. 編成はまぁまぁ 嫌いではない(о´∀`о) If the *ahem* splatoons cut their hair off I think it has density of like jello so like a playdough knife would do the trick and it wouldn't hurt them since SQUIDS do regenerate. Hey squid, how did that last game go again? Love, Army vet."wait what the fuck is a tentacool if it's not a squid" - iceI hope made some spaghetti today! 0w0 It's a complete joke. Delay release and then go backwards with the gameplay after release. This game needs to go forwards not back to bf1 gunplay. Who the hell is making the decisions thereSquid. Kid. Octopus. It matters not on the battlefield. All lose their innocence in the Ink War. Splatoon 2 in 30 minutes. Okay, they had BETTER update the game so that we can hear their singles like the Squid Sisters amiibo in Splat 1! We need that after Splatfests are gone!  More squid pro ro in this administration than the Japanese breakfast buffet in Naha. No surprise the dirt merchants at Enquirer (Pecker) flipped. It’s okay officer she’s a squid nowイカ(Squid)は水の中に出現する8本の触手を持つMobである。イカは他の地上の温厚なMobと同じく、常にプレイヤーに対して受動的だ。イカはどの深さ、どのバイオームでも水の中でも見つかり、どの難易度でも出現する。  OK so does everyone know the notmyttk bs does nothat work and will not work just like the not my battlefield one did not work try using your brains and spell out why the old ttk was better ranging like 2 year Olds does not work be adult's and give good worded reasons. Can't you run squid as the lab user, and make the config writable to that user? Iirc you can include files by putting "/path/include.conf" in squid.conf, instead of the actual value. This way kill -s HUP (pidof squid) would suffice.I kno rkelly a terrible person but can’t lie he snapped on 7 squids 😓 いかすみさん抜きまくってたねｗHoney I shrunk the squid 633 Squid Ron  The squid's 14/15, and Joker's 16 But he definitely did a big WRONG I would t know, I quit playing.

Just had to spend the start of my day finishing up that essay lol :)squid と nginx どっち使おう.. We really don't care! Just give us our game back! If another update comes out TTK remains then I'm done with BF franchise catering to everyone but their loyal players The gay squid Makes sense. Some squid use light and color shifts to attract mates. Squid.... Read the room. Now is not the time to post floss. Face into the issue and until then, perhaps consider if posting clips of your YouTube friends is the smart thing to do. The Squid Sisters aren't in this one, so replacing Fresh Start and Calamari Inkantation with Into the Light and Fly Octo Fly, with Shark Bytes on top of that, this concert is already nearing 40 minutes. I will VERY surprised (and VERY delighted) if they get solo numbers. stop drawing splatoon porn you fucking squid yiffers Get fukt No joke the first time I saw Futaba I thought it was someone's Squid Girl Gijinka lol given he gets bossed around by literally everything that moves including some things that aren't even real and one vampire this isn't a surprise Side note - If you guys play PC at all. Check out Insurgency Sandstorm. Just came out uhhhh yesterday. Its right now. Coming to consoles 2019. smooth as silk no splinters here! Also, I know that kludges that run with suid 0 are dangerous, but I (somewhat?) know what I'm doing, since I have the need to make certain aspects of squid's configuration constantly modifiable without being root, and it has to not require sudo to do it. It is for an IT lab.Melone's Di Molto Squid Ink Pasta. Bahaha all the TTK comments. But yeah , back to the original TTK please.  new name is the Squid Squad 🐙 🚨 🐙   I could see the set list as: 1. Color Pulse 2. Muck Warfare 3. Acid Hues 4. Pearl's Single 5. Marina's Single 6. Nasty Majesty 7. Fly Octo Fly 8. Now or Never (IF the Squid Sisters show up for this one, it'll be a treat. OtH has the same amount of tracks as SS now.) Fix chat log on PS4! Also change the TTK back please! Thank you  Reset the ttk back ,,😡😡😡 role back the TTKQuick question has anyone been able to battle the Squid Sisters Spirit yet in Ultimate if so was the opponent you faced Agent 3 cuz Splat 1’s hero mode since Callie and Marie are Agents 1 and 2 in the new Squid beak Splatoon. I’m curious. Unfortunately not Squid Sisters, but was quite predictable, because Squid Sisters they do not appear in Octo Expansion and they do not have any music too.Squid Squad - Kraken Up (Bobo Localisation)O novo concerto da Off The Hook não terá a participação das Squid Sisters, e muita gente tá dizendo que a Nintendo tá matando elas. Eu sinceramente não entendo o nível da burrice dessas pessoas, como que elas acham depois de tudo que rolou esse ano, meu ateísmo! 🤦 Wasn't sure if you'd recognize me without that squid comment, lolalso squid took me 3 days to do lmao anywayhad to reupload the squid several times because my layers were all kinds of messed up*HELP I'M STUCK IN SQUID FORM I CAN ONLY COMMUNICATE THROUGH TELEKINESIS*Combine 4 1/2 tbsps Squid with 4 cups chicken. Add generous amounts of Ale. Roast. Serve on a bed of pasta Honey I Shrunk the Squids  Hopefully it doesn't track their progression so they can go through the same hell as the rest of us! Oh damn! So we will get Into the light, Nasty Majesty, and Fly Octo Fly I assume. Will we get to hear their Splatfest version of Now or Never like the Squid sisters did? AGAIN! the mission dont work and the whole tree ist bugged.  "Silent community" = noobs who will casually play and don't give a squirt about the balance. "Vocal community" = long time fans of which you're alienating. You chose the former. You played yourself. DAS SQUID Doesn't it though..??Helped that the Squid Sisters assist trophy spawned made the fight slightly easier even tho I used a Spirit slightly more powerful then recommended power of 9,700 defense type on The Inkling Girl the battle was against with one additional Inkling Girl plus I used Agent 3Squid are weary honorjunkies and sneaky criminals are out-of-control - but life is sweet, I love you!  Fix the TTK back to normal.  Squid will you ever make an ARK server? the only thing* wilder than this movie's squid are its song choices revert ttk or i refund this shit Can we just fix the game so I dont have to close my application EVERY TIME I try to load into a new map? It's testing my patience and I'm losing interest in playing until it's fixedBet the boys thought they were squids in with that octopus  Oh cool at least the challenges are unlocking for some people... Papa? looks like squid word on the bottom plateYou son of a squid Lmaoooo wtffff I think I just watched a squid rape a school girl 😩😩😩😩 When TTK fix?  I call him Swanward (this is a reference to the popular tv show Spongebob which has the character "Squidward" (Squid + ward), this time replacing the Squid with Swan. It is a double entendre since it also combines Coward + Swan together)  You should work on reverting the ttk.  Happy birthday  Awww, he'd be so happy! He's such a happy, social boy lol  Fix the TTD instead please, relearning weapons after playing for a month is unfair to the loyal players from day one. I'm hunting for improved TTD and TTK. Still waiting... Congrats on driving the competitive and die hard fans away already, you know, the ones that were gonna keep this game alive  Because they die fast? Where you were at this time, on the moon? They are whining since D1 because people from behind kills them quickly and can't slowly turn to shoot back at them... They aren’t performing with Squid Sisters this timegreen papaya. . .12 finger squid. . .10 korean brown rice-sea salt veggie burger. . .20 Hey possible bonding? Squid and ash? Bye ur vids were the best back then! Have a great day! Bring back the old TTK please. It was one of the many reasons I pre-ordered the game and it was fine. We don't need or want this change. Also, the chat log isn't showing on PS4 [not that important].  fix the netcode fix the TTK fix the Ping server for french Polynesia and hawaii (bf1 100-130 ...

FIX UR GAME, UR LITERALLY TAKING THE PISS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY. ITS LIKE U WANT THE ATTENTION.  Might be the final nail in the coffin. If it wasn't BF I would have kicked it to the curb before launch after all the shit they've pulled.They need to pause, have a come to Jesus meeting and get a fucking clue or this is the end of the franchise  New TTK is HORRIBLE, old TTK was so GOOD I Want To Be At Home Playing Squids Why the hell cant the squid sisters show up on any levelI’m making squids I think an even more accurate adaptation would be one where even after learning people will probably celebrate his death, he still doesn't care. unfortunately, these animals like any deep sea creatures are hard to study in their natural habitat so little is known about the vampire squid at the moment.instead of uselessly releasing ink into the dark mesoperagic zone, vampire squids expel a colorless substance of bioluminescent material. these twinkling lights confuse potential predators.Vampire squids are not predatory, in fact, it´s quite harmless. They depend on the food particles that it captures using it´s sticky cells on it´s tentacles.the vampire squid has been around for 300 million years!A vampire squid is a small cephalopod is around 28 centimeters ( 11 inches ). females are also typically bigger than the males. because the species rarely come across each other, they mate whenever they have the chance.Christmas Luncheon lasted 3 hours 😂😂 oysters, squid, steak, sides and dessert.. the whole shabangabang.. it's really naptime lolYou want me to show my dick? Fuck it. *Puts on squid hat* There's my dick. save the game pls I simply got discouraged from the game due to this update, unfortunate what they did with the TTK of the game.

Permanent Preservation Version Let Squid Host Club Bud Bud Bud Bud Bud Is The Absence Of Covered So I prefer the new TTK. Sorry. Just buff SMGs and fix TTD....thank you :) Can they help you roll back this godawful new TTK to the original please?! This change smacks of meddling for money over gamer satisfaction. Gun play is now terrible!  What are you doing!!!!! You really want to kill this game. Dont blame it on "To many players have stopped playing cause they die quick" No there leaving cause the game is broke. And now your hard core fans about to leave too smh.  They fucked the game up! It’s garbage now! Don’t buy! It was for me yesterday can you like... not try to one up me my guy and sound like and asshole while ya do it?

Fallout 76 is still 60 bucks (on ps4) and that games dog shit just because it's 60 bucks doesn't mean it's good .... G O O D D A Y l0l  What are you going to send this tweet once for every bullet required to kill an opponent with an smg under the new ttk? Cause i already got it 6 times. So how many times are you guys going to delete and reinstate this tweet in an attempt to avoid how much you screwed up? How long until you own up to it and REVERT THESE TTK CHANGES?   what are you on about now? get out of my mentions. 🙄 Fix the Netcode not the TTK and bring it back from Conquest Core to all the game modes! The cryin' kiddos -that can't aim/play- are still complaining about the new TTK they wanted because now it takes too long to get a frag.  Y'all revert that TTK yet? Yeah but fix the game so it saves progress made on tides of war instead of erasing it! 6th time posting!! 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄  zelda breath of the wild is still 60 while this game that JUST came out is 26. the only logical reason for a game to be that cheap is if it's not making enough money so they lower the price. ok? good day Roll back the TTK it's destroying the game Already got it boiss comedy is opinionated why do you think people still like amy schumer? Aaaw thank you Ali ;w; *hugs cute squid* yeah I've been sick since Tuesday ;w; see ya :) Because... it's 20 bucks? that not really enough evidence but ok it makes you look under the age of 12 and sound unintelligent lol. Salty does not mean "retarded." I'm muting this conversation. , enjoy your evening. Thank you for the entertainment while I was on hold on a phone call. BLYAT, enjoy Battlefield lol. but its not a joke...? I legit think that you're slow in the head for thinking that battlefield 5 isnt dead when the evidence is obv Because i use sapces and caps k lol makes human sense big brain plays from robin   By typing in all caps, spacing out your letters, and saying "origionaly" - I think automatically disqualifies you from this debate. Good day sir. what makes you think i'm mad? lol i could say the same for you for callin me basically retardedット年齢制限がどうとか言ってるけど、子供に使わせるパソコンにはフィルタリングソフト入れたほうがいいと思う。そして子供がそれを突破する技術を持ち始めたら、プロキシサーバにSquidを噛ませて… とレベルアップしていけば高校生になる頃にはサーバー管理者。 origionaly funny internet joke from origional funny internet man number 236   C O O L I O I D I D N ' T G E T T H O S E N O T I F I C A T I O N S Because I enjoyed previous Battlefield releases. I enjoyed Battlefield 3. Battlefield 4. Battlefield Bad Company. I'm a fan of the franchise therefor I believe that's a valid reason to follow the page, is it not? Is following a page considered stalking it? Social Media is public. I know, I'm on your side on this LOL it's just that this guys really saltyI launch a starlet for squid, upstart, and rump at walmart oh no my opinion is invalid because a grocery store is selling it for a semi resonable price because it isn't finished. Otter Brains, squid ink and meercat tongue Every major station has a gentleman's club where poshos can eat rare animal meat in a bap whilst playing card games. Sorry for bringing this unnecessary fame to your notifications. Just trying to determine what people enjoy about this game.... and backing you up saying that the games dead. :p I already answered this question like twice. -_- Any word on tracker fixes because I've saved loads of people as assault and still no progress nah i just said that 'cause if he hates the game and has stated why..... than why would he wanna stalk the twitter feed for a game he thinks is shit? M A K E S H U M A N S E N S E he's just a little slow in the head. its ok tho and its already 26 dollars. L  I follow the page so it showed it. stop assuming what I do. also, I didn't make the tweet for "attention" (I still got it tho LMFAO). I made it to stand my ground and share my opinion about the game being dead. Is "asking for attention" your argumentative response to everything you don't agree with? It just came out my duerino if ya wanna talk dead look at fallout 76  What the hell have you done to this game!!!!! Revert the TTK changes!   Okay, but let us do that by reversing TTK  K lol than why did you make a post asking for attention? if ya don't like it maybe you shouldn't stalk the BF twitter threads. Trust me man, I'm not complaining. I haven't bought the game for a reason so I'm enjoying this dumpster fire of everybody else complaining. Best believe I've watched livestreams of the game though enough to form a valid opinion on it.literally hit a let it go motion with that controller last night 😂. i underestimated how hard the squid kids can hit because it's a dead game. read the original tweet, my guy. ^ than why complain about it? why shove reviews in my face? You haven't even played it my guy Nah I'm good thanks mate, I enjoy playing bfv with friends and it's fun and have a good life mate see ya round if the game is getting dogshit reviews. im not wasting my money lol But have I what? Bought the game? I mean .... 2.5 / 10 seems really appealing. Maybe its worth the . ... maybeeeeee. I'm not a gambler though. Not going to risk it. Because Walmart is where i buy all of my video games. ok enjoy buddy. go buy fallout 76 too while ya at it I love the game, and therefore I stand by the movement of . Do what's best for the game,  Wanted - with 70 to 100 multiplayer maps for a really massive online shooter in the near future. Enough of the ancient war games. Are you doing Battlefield Vikings too?????????? Get back to the winning formula !!!!!! B U T H A V E Y O U ? I F N O T W H Y A R E Y O U H E R E  Please revert the changes to the ttk  LMAOOOO  When are we going to see an airborn map only? Perhaps bombers vs bombers with small planes defending them, Bombing target, the mustang? silly squid, honey nuts are for kids reviews show how people are enjoying the game. dumb Who cares ? Really ? Just FIX THE TTK TRAINWRECK add some guns, vehicles and this will be game of the year  cool designs So ya using reviews instead of how much fun you had.... kinda sad lol  Well I bought the game and it's great, but if you don't enjoy it hey that's your opinion I respect that  Im not great at this game but the ttk was better before and the game was more enjoyable Also why does it take like 5 mins from when you start 'quit' to get back to the main menu... ffs Players aren't to happy with the increased tkk. Fix the bugg instead and reset ttk to the old values.  Thank u so much!! 💕💕(　；∀；)   “Oh hey, here’s a silly little stream while we ignore our playerbase!” We should boycott this goddamn game if they’re so concerned with an active playerbase. Show them that in order to win a bunch of people who won’t even play for a month, they’ll lose all their long term fans. becuase call of duty would've made this game irrelevant I hate the new TTK, nobody asked to changed, besides your Data that let me remind you, THEY DONT BUY THE GAMES WE THE PLAYERS DO lmao that's why no one bought the game and they delayed it Shame progress doesn't save towards tides quests and resets... fucking bullshit. But you'll never reply.. 5th post.. never gunna stop until it's fixed   :) It's not dead there's lot of evidence for the contrary. Stop trying to get attention its a shame not all of us can join this, my missions are bugged and my xp is gone, what is happening and when will it be fixed ? Did you hear the story of Darth TTK the wise? I thought so...   listen to your community  It's not dead... stop trying to get attention.    Shame it’s bugged so they can’t get it this games dead, stop trying. You will be a squid as punishment. Incorrect they are squids...but also kids?...ill be honest the mythos is a bit confusing? There's a Support role abuse too, they pick the weapon with the highest rate of fire to get fast kills to counter the TTK change. (； ･`д･´)ﾅﾝ…ﾀﾞﾄ!?捨てた... マダオは部屋が大変な事になっててどうにもならんw 何人のサンタいるんだよwwwi dont want steven to become a squid これ可愛かったよなぁ！！1から作るの大変だな😂💦 dhdjd i was thinking that too, just kept finding people stopping in place n lookin around before getting on with inking idk if they were trying to bait into squid partying but they got me every time :'( What a squid. Talk about being a stat nerdSquid Sisters - Calamari Inkantation (Sakizaya Localisation) love you squid!! Now it’s twice as many wannabe snipers going for headshots if anything it’s making it more like cod with the BS amount of snipers So your saying it should take more rounds to kill someone like Halo ? I hate COD but you shouldn’t be Mag dumping in a fucking WW2 FPS lol no matter the game mode end of story . It was good as it was Change the TTK BACK!!!!! Gameplay same as bf1 now, SHIT Of course! Squid hugs are for everybody 🦑💞💞💞C’mon guys the Squid Sisters have always been with OtH at their concerts, allow them to try it alone for once!

Thanks!Squid Sisters - Spicy Calamari Inkantation (Navarro-Labourdin Localisation) hey colbert you and your writer are going to wind up in prison before its all over with you are a pathetic little squid you know that if you didnt know it you know it nowsquids scare the shit out of me “My family and I don’t always see eye-to-eye. But sometimes a family is a holy warrior and a clown on a grand adventure, and that’s okay.”   SO VERY PROUD OF YOU. ILY SQUID But is the squid a kid now? 🤔 This got worse Да что-то не хотелось бы 😄 i would totally bang a squid kidYOU'RE A KID NOW YOU'RE A SQUID NOW Y O U ' R E A K I D Y O U ' R E A S Q U I D Y O U ' R E A K I D Y O U ' R E A S Q U I D Y O U ' R E A K I Oh Lord 😒 Stop crying and learn to aim.... tha foack 😤 Kiddos shouldnt play war anyway...😤 🤬 its a squid with squiddies! My penchant for cute animal videos has ruined several things for me. I can no longer eat squid/octopus beef. I gave up lamb a while ago never touched veal anyhoo (BABBY!) So please, please keep your cute piggy videos away from me. Bacon is all I have left.  YES !!! THATS IT !!! SOMEONE WHO HAS THE BALLS TO SAY THE TRUTH !!! All those CoD Hipfire Quickscope Kiddos should go back to CoD ! None of them wants to Aim... And its ridiculous that ur gun is precise like that with hipfire... REVERT THE TTK 10/10 u hit it on point  Please just change back the TTK! I saved up for a long time to buy this game, and I loved it. Now it's just frustrating!    Bring back ttk don’t want any of that squid heat happy birthday you beautiful creature. Have an amazing day sid ❤️ what thw fuck was that gjfjfj R u sure? I remember a lot of complaints about it. But eh, I dont really care too much. It just seems to me that DICE could solve every problem and people would still complain it wasn't enough. And with every new tweet that doesn't mention a ttk revert everyone just gets more pissed :D Are you going to ignore your comunity? Quorum sensing is used by the beneficial symbiont of the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Vibrio fischeri, to regulate bioluminescence and other colonization traits. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i'd already have it if it didnt reset hi u eat squids mode I had same restarted, and joined a game by clicking the tides of war section in the multiplayer menu just to make sure.  I believe that sardines, octopus, and squid are most certainly part of the heart-healthy Mediterranean diet. 🤔 I welcome our new squid overlords Happy bday!!  Kwara to Sokoto back then, nothing to beat back then o.... it's 13 hours + or - 2 hours. U start and end the day right on the jny. U just got to hope he driver stop in Niger or somewhere for food, then u can squid qasr and jam'u, otherwise.....mind solah for insurance🙂Why is the orange squid amiibo like the most expensive one. Hello, Waifu! Do you remember me? I'm one of Rising Squid's staff. We talked at Rising Squid Lan. Thank you for your support! We should have taken some photos 😂 Very carefullySquid Suit It's far too easy, me and a freind managed to do it in 1 and a half round one on hamada and half a round on fjell Tides of War Reward (Revive Squad Members) not working for me on Xbox ✌🏻Happy birthday squid! 🦑 🎊🎉🎈  Had the same restart the game and try again after 3-4 times its counting Hey you fix bug in xbox.. Fuck   Awesome 💯👍 wake up dice ...look the community after today patch. While inklings are mere squid, I must say, they are extremely fashionable. Not my TTK Change the TTK back, your ruining your own game. Putting soo much effort into having top notch gun play, destroyed.   I remember reading something like this where a woman got sick after drinking it. And how the "spoiled" coconut looked squid-like The search for alien life continues. We need to find SOMETHING. I don't care if it's triangles or space squids, lizard people or King Ghidorah. FIND ONE  You should check out this guy is a beast! Just stick your heads in the sand and try to forget about The TTK Trainwreck   Just revert the TTK and dont do so like nobody complain about this ...  Can we take a second to realize he was dating a bounty hunter, royalty, a goddess, and an under age squid You should be working on pleasing you core player and revert the TTK!  Wasn't everyone pissed off and outraged about the TTK before the changes and now everyone wants them back to how they were? It seems like no matter what does, everyone is simply going to be pissed. That's not fair. Fix your tides of war shit so when we actually do stuff towards it it saves the progress! GET A PATCH ASAP... TTK is fine.. and I've played since Bad Company 2 days.. too many people want quick kills like COD.. Oh shit! Happy birthday, , my dad, and ’ dad!  I'm working towards it too people lol getting it today Thanks hun Let’s go squid we’ll meet halfway Bring back the proper TTK and give us a PROPER hardcore instead. Thanks Love, Kris  Keep ignoring the TTK issue and soon you'll have no players left to even post tweets about. ありがとうございます！！🥰 Fix the Netcode not the TTK and bring it back from Conquest Core to all the game modes! The cryin' kiddos - that can't aim/play - are still complaining about the new TTK they wanted because now it takes too long to get a frag. They should go back to Fortshit  game theory: the real pipimi is a brain slug controlling a shell body pride squid is my copilot I never been so spawncamped in any other BF before and invisibly killed by ghosts without being able to respond it makes me rage quit. CHANGE IT BACK PLEASE!  please change it back Dice and focus resources instead on the TTD bug 👍Am I the only one confused on which way squid swim?  Same...squid fast eat ass  Why am I not getting my Buddy revives counted? No, I am not playing as a medic! It is just broken...  Lol...You described it perfectly, "get stuck". I picked up my squad mates several times using the assualt class and none of them would count towards the progression. This is getting so frustrating. Again? Not to be mean about this to fans but the SS already had their time and now it's OtH's turn. The Squid Sisters are cool and all but I wanna see more OtH and this concert is a great opportunity to hear more songs from OE. What’s wrong with it? fam. it had squid in it.  That's the problem with schools using systems like sQuid or ParentMail - they don't have direct access to things.   Done and done It's like they don't even see the community outrage of the TTK. Please revert the TTK values back to what they were before! I don't want to come back until this is fixed. "Ehhhh? Squid people? That seems really interesting. Uhm... May I meet your kids? Pleeeeeeeease?" Revert this horrible TTK update. It was the absolute last thing we needed. "They are adorable human like figure kids with tentacles for hair and turn to squids." Let’s not forget the planes either squid😂 Poor squid boi i knew it, i knew you were a Hung Bitch It’s on Saturday. Going for dinner to a Dutch restaurant. May go genever tasting and also karaoke. Going to cook some seafood the day before. Squid, oysters, some octopus legs and maybe some salt cod. 😁😁😁 aaa no call bc I'm sick as hell but i can do squid game for a few hours!Spongebob: Aw, cheer up, Squid! It could be worse!
