 全員集合！！！ 俺もおそらく職場の上司らしき人物が最近Twitter始めた通知が来た… これって、向こうにも通知行くのかな？確認したく無いけど THE GLOWING SQUID!! WHO’D SAY NO TO THAT??? what brush do u use for lineart?? :0 ALSO THIS IS AMAZING 😭 He’s just happy she’s not trying to kill him. “oh thank cod- I thought for second I was gonna be a dead squid there.” I think im going moobloom honestly. I rly don't like the thought of more villager type mobs since we have a lot already and the glow squid is cute but we got a BUNCH of water updates lately. I just think the cows neat ;w; don't be so dramatic... the iceologer isent that bad... it can't fly, it would spawn alone and you can probably just use a shield to block its attacks its better than removing dirt to stop moobloom from making everything flowers and stealing your bees or a retextured squid.... GLOWSQUID SUPREMACY GLOW SQUID KIDDDDD 333But he's popular with the squid kids, so I guess that makes him hip. I think there is a bugger event on that day did y'all forget about from , it's your 10 year old baby that's having a party called Vote on mob vote btw Moobloom, glow squid , iceologer btw they added a new drop for the glow squid prismarine crystals Idk but I like the glowing squid Di naman, kasi diba ÷2 yung rate due to pandemic. GLOW👏SQUID👏 I hate the squids :cAll of the information comes from where each mob comes from. Glow squids and mooblooms come from Minecraft Earth and Icelogers come from Minecraft Dungeons. What’s worrying is in Minecraft Dungeons, Ice Logers don’t drop anything. The least we might get are emeralds. おはよー( ˘ω˘ ) ｽﾔｧ…Squid Sisters - Now or Never! (Basa-Kontagora Localisation) Follow back so I can add! Dude if nobody voted based on speculation, would be destroyed because the Iceologer would just be a mob that attacks you. I would vote for the moobloom because it attracts bees, but it only spawns in a rare biome so I'll vote for Glow Squid for ambience. or you can just use a texture pack, besides the glow squid in the video is just an animation to simulate you getting distracted by them while your traveling its just a bit bald if you ask me, I would rather get a ne combat mechanic and have to use a shield than a retextured squid Biden: blah blah blah stuff about the country and whatev- Trump: WRONG WRONG WRONG Personally im voting for The glow squid to be in minecraft (too young to vote lol) GLOW SQUID SOOOO DISTRACTING So hypnotising glowing squid? HELL YES *BANGS TABLE* GLOWING SIREN SQUID グッバイ！セプテンバー！！ ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)ﾉｼ Squids the flower forest is already a biome, but i think it will add so much !! hopefully it'll revolutionise flower and honey farming, i will vote glow squid, since i think it would be really cool for decorating like, underground secret laboratories, coves and stuff :)I'm a Moobloom voter and proud. We didn't even like it the first time they gave us squids and I hate the pillagers always T-Posing outside my house.  Great prize! Thanks for the competition.  Si el Glow squid tiene 10³⁸⁴ fans yo soy uno de ellos,y toda la wea que lleva el copy Glowing squid and the reason why it's glowing it's because of radiation. Nah, vote the Glowstone Squid 😉 you probably hate me So do the squid, it does something different from the normal oneIf iceager wins the the fucking vote i swear to god, we have 3 different types of cows, but they could help with bee farms, glow squids gives us a different type of interesting squid that could drop new loot, and seemingly has a hipnosis effect that could spice up gameplay, (1) We already talk with dogs, but it's pretty limited conversation. I'd rather talk to species with more to offer, like any of the apes, ravens, parrots, even squid. They'd offer something new. Oh yeah. I'm a squid. I deals🤣🤣🤣🤣 Semper Fi my sis! Huge yes please from me this be wonderful treat :) “....little squid. Mine.” Bruh glow squid is stupid the iceologer is definitely the best choice bruh the glow squid is just a squid that glow how does that make the game more fun I want piss cow. Contrarily, I am prepared to trade mooshrooms to also get glow squid. Ice villager is a dumb loser though and I hate himif you vote for anything other than the glow squid, you don’t deserve rights /j /lhWhat mob is everyone voting for? A: Iceologer B: Moobloom C: Glow Squid Tell me in the comments! (Mine is Iceologer!) Moobloom is supposed to interact with bees. Not sure exactly how. But I can already get plenty of flowers or floral dyes from a flower forest. I don't see a need for it. And the glow squid gives no guarantee of providing a light source or doing anything beyond looking nice. Lmao hell yeah, tho I like hypnosis a lot more than squids lol Atleast it has fucking ice magic and drops a new weapon unlike the fucking useless squid and cow I want glow squid :(I WILL PAY A MINECRAFT MODDER TO GIVE YOU A YELLOW COW WITH A FLOWER THAT ACTUALLY PEES, SO YALL CAN HAVE YOUR PEE PEE COW MEME! AND YOU KNOW THEY CAN DO IT! VOTE GLOW SQUID! our minecraft oceans at night need it! MAX NO PICK THE GLOW SQUID! BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY! 😭LRT ME AND SQUID AAAAA -dies- O iceolager virou modinha e vai ser só mais 1 na família dos illagers A Glow Squid não vai servir pra porra nenhuma E a MoobLoom vai servir pro fazer uma Farm de flores, fora q vai ser uma add fofinha e pacíficaWould you rather have a piss cow, a gray villager, or A GLOWING FUCKING SQUID Sleep you Hobby Squid (I still see your name as that) Is that the " I had 4 of these so SURE I'll try that wierd alien looking Squid thing and fries!" Lol? O iceolager se tornou modinha e ele vai ser só mais um na família dos illagers A Glow Squid vai ser inútil E a MoobLoom vai espalhar flores por aí, vai ser amiga das abelhas e concerteza o vai usar ela pra fazer uma Farm de flores 👤I like glow squid I’m voting for glow squid only problem he’s ver lame おはよごす〜 Do you like hypnosis, minecraft squids, or both lolAm i the only one who dousnt want the ice illager or the moobloom. Everyone is gonna hate the ice illager because it will be like the ice skeleton and it will be super op and i want to live in the mountain with a pet glowy squid and a goat:(If we don't get iceologer or glow squid I will literally drink a cup of water. Yes dis meI dont want to sound ungrateful but why are we only getting one new mob? How hard is it to code a cow with flowers and a squid that glows? Idk seems weird  how many people actually play only on peaceful? For voting for glow squid, couldn’t the same logic be extended to diving deep into oceans? I’m personally going with the iceologer because if 1.17 is a mountain update it’ll make it feel like more of a substantial change 😶 🥺 SIM MANO, SIM E eu quero ver qm é q vai me impedir Tp, a Glow Squid é inútil e o iceolager é só mais um pra família dos illagers, fora q tá na modinha votar nele E eu tô desde 2019 teimando pra Mojang colocar ela no jogo (pois ela já está no Earth mobs)Mix 2 cups caviar with 2 cups Squid . Adorn with Orange Juice. Fry. Serve the next morning for breakfast.glow squid supremacy I agree! I also want the squid for AMBIENCE We dont need a 3rd cow or a 7th illager it literally has to be the squid Retextured evoker, but with ice retextured squid, but it glows retextured mooshroom, but with flowers and honey They’re all retextured and reused concepts and ideas, so stop using that as a reason to vote iceologer oooo you will become a squid oooo glow squid is easy to make with a texture pack moobloom will be just another cow and if it works like in minecraft earth will be very annoying to deal with since you would have to take out all the dirt arround it and both of them will just drop the same as there variants.Minecraft glow squid and flower cow god I've gotten to the point of Twitter dot com where people are mentioning me about hypnosis minecraft squids what is my life I would like the moobloom or iceologer to win, Glow Squid is not very interesting like the other two, in my opinion, but I will like it the same way if she wins os cara brigando com tudo que tem, não importa o quanto briguem, a Glow Squid vai ganhar  VOTE GLOW SQUID If u look at the video very carefully u will see they have snorkels this could be just a video but there is a chance they could add this to the game it wouldn’t make sense but neither does this update and imagine a squid that can hypnotize others that would be dope Happy Birth month!!! 😃🌇🐔🐣☀️💓🎵👏🎊︎💕︎✨ 🍺∩(´^ヮ^｀)∩🍺I hope made some spaghetti today! 0w0 バナナオーレ………φ(．．)ﾒﾓﾒﾓ 答えください(笑) その真っ赤な酢だこ美味いよね‼︎‼︎ TBM MANO, TÔ DESDE 2019 TEIMANDO PRA MOJANG COLOCAR ELA NO MINE A Glow Squid não vai servir pra porra nenhuma e o iceolager tá na modinha falar q vai votar pra ele, fora q é só mais uma add de merda pra família dos illagers めっちゃ気になるミラクルその2(笑) I'm with chillager but I ain't bouta be too mad if the squid wins if the cow wins I'm throwing handsminecraft please just add all three please i jus i just cant pick between glow squid and piss cow the idea of a mob that can hypnotize you iis so cool but also ppiss cow Thank you..never met him..but heard he was a really good guy..a lot like my grandfather..would of been nice, just grateful my father served in a part that was not heavy in combat made it home..I joke call him Squid..he was a frogman..on a U boat..thank you brothers. There are also 3 variants of the illager, so the MooBloom or the Iceologer being picked isn't going to be a problem. I'm just afraid the Iceologer will be the next phantom, I suppose. Glow squid will maybe drop a material that will provide a new light source. nu squid needs his sleep Does he...you know... *squid hands* ...stay fresh? Yeah and the iceologer would be no different. Thats why I want something more aesthetically pleasing to be used in builds like the glow squid. what does the cow do? both the cow and squid do fuck all ありがとうございます。最近、またクラセレ熱が、再燃して、楽しく打ってるんですが…じじーなんで、思い出せないこと多数でして… はさみで、打ってて、中中、どっちのスイカ🍉も、OKなんすけど.体が勝手に鳥鳥7を狙ってたんす。でも、待てよ…と思って、気になって、気になって 連絡してしまいました ぐっさんにバナナオーレ飲んでもらえば、もしかしたらケントくんもミラクル起きるかもー He is so awesome qwq あんた何やってるの？ って感じになりました♪ Did you actually just bring up a squid fact i- squid shiokara🤭 I want to vote for the glow squid, but there doesn't seem anything interesting about it, we have no information on what it drops or what separates it from regular squids. Iceologer is the only mob that actually makes a difference if it's in the game. GLOW SQUIDS ARE EPIC YOU CAN KEEP THEM AS PETS AND THEY FUCKING GLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW O iceolager é só mais um na família dos Villagers, não vai fazer diferença e mais de 1 bilhão de pessoas já tão dizendo q vão votar nele, isso tá chato Man A Glow Squid eu tô poco me fudendo Ent a MoobLoom é perfectSessick / 合食禁 ・ベースをつとめるIKKANは、無印のBGMを担当したバンド｢Squid Squad｣のメンバー BEES ARE SWEET AND COMMON IT MIGHT BE BC IM LUCKY BUT FUCK SQUIDS Glow squid is aesthetically pleasing Squid doesn't actually glow so pee cow They’ve been in Minecraft Earth since February and they drop imo sacs like any other squid.Am craving BBQ Squid something fierce. Humboldt squid don’t need no launcher; they launch theyself I'm not confused. You're not up to speed. Rothbard died a long time ago. The people actively exploring ideas of racial segregation *today* includes the far left. So hope I win OZZYさんおはよーです(*ﾟ∀ﾟ*) ギターのいかちゃん🎸👩🤘 ツイッター表示を簡易設定にしてるのでいきなり画像が表示されないのだけど、ちゃんと見えるようにしたら４枚目でビックリして朝からコーヒー吹き出しそうに squid ya autistPizza? Only if it has squids on it! めっちゃ気になるミラクル(笑) *Pats the three* I would bring in squid but he's asleep.. (I think) Glow squid I interpret that completely differently. Simply that the squid is so beautiful the player is mesmerized by it and doesn't get anything else done. We'll see. I think y'all just voted for the iceologer because it looks cool(same with the phantom). I vote for the glow squid because it's stupidly awesome They’ll exist and do a better job than glow squid and ice illager The glow squid is a passive mob and I think the "hypnotic" powers the glow squid wilk have is just players starring at them. They won't actually remove control from you. Glow squid FTW the squid? Despite not being the same thing as me I consider Jacal, Harold, Snowy and squid as part of pack, and I'll hurt anyone that does anything to a member of my pack. Id say shaking but I'm already disappointed Would like to see the tropical slime since we could use a new beach biome in update and if the tropical slime get added it could be(if the glow squid wins) the first animated mob! I feel like Mojang didn't really hype up the moobloom and the glow squid enough. The chillager appears to be the best but I think the glow squid has the most potential. ☺️Franklin I will feed you to the squid. ありま… LOOK AT THIS MAN HES A SQUID AND HES GLOWING FUCK BEES ALL MY HOMES HATE BEES THEY'RE RARE AF AND STUPID even before the mob vote the glow squid was the only one i really wanted, and that stays true. Then again I haven't played dungeons. I'd like to see the illusioner be finished, maybe using the dungeons design! My poor man is just being ignored and they're even adding new illager! Note how i said deep ocean and not just ocean The ocean isn't a single biome, it's a collection of multiple biomes icy and deep oceans still need unique mobs while warm oceans get tropical fish, pufferfish and turtles no need to call me a dumbass for liking squids too thanks What does your squid do nothing moo bloom is bee friend The chillager is cringe. Moobloom or glow squid is where it at 😤✊I was making a glow squid in lender and it crashed and i forgot to save so now i have to start all over :( Yup gotta know more. Can you leave a message of your own. We're pulling for the prince squidI'm a fucking squid now,and if you can't respect that,you can go fuck off. boys in my class ate the squids beak eyes.I love ! This is just "here's another squid, same but a tiny little bit different" 🤷🏼‍♂️ it’s more notable just how little has done in this pandemic – a giant vampire squid sucking life out of actual people (kinda literally). I heard you can milk the squidSquid Squad - Ink or Sink (Asoa Localisation) guess you can die to gas now Can’t believe you got this instead of ds3 or something Ok squid Yeah but the squid literally does nothing at least we know the moobloom and iceolger atleast do something glow squid is just a variant of squid that glows lol vote for glow squid cause glow squid piss cow phantom 2.0 To be fair I did squid bag you earlier in the match, but still hilarious I don’t know what my first memory of you is; probably something on the forums. I know I saw some of your films before I joined and I remember watching Planet of the Sneeuwpop when I was supposed to be doing homework and getting internet privileges taken away for the day.😩 I refuse to add a mountain hazard and the moobloom just seems boring. I'm unironically voting glow squid It’s really hard to choose a favorite from a filmography like yours but I think We the Pumpkins Three takes the cake for me. The lighting is so atmospheric and I have a big soft spot for the fantastical lore you’ve built for Riigo Faloo. It has a great story too. I could see why people would vote for them, they'd be useful for flower farming Glow squid is completely useless Glow squidsIceologers suck, and glow squids are better than moobloom (but I'm fine with moobloom winning).  Yeah. I found out though just now from reading my new tweets that the whole hypnosis thing was just a gag and the glow squids are just reskins of normal skins, likely with a animated skin. try to eat meat like duck meat a lot of fish like salmon octopus crab blue fishes squid and to have more strength eat lion cocodrile ox kangaroo wild pig meat iguana meat too, eat a lot of tubers like sweet potato, beet, yucca, potato, radish etc. eat mushroooms そしたらおれ未易だわ🥺  DREAM GLOW SQUID TEAM???? CAN WE GET DREAM STANS TO JOIN GLOW SQUID TEAM!??!?!?!?I found out what the thing is and im totally voting for the funky squid So that means they are useless as a light source no matter how you look at the glow squid. Glow squid is the best option, we have far too many hostile mobs and villager variants for the iceloger, moobloom is kind of useless. Squids have been just a black dye farm for years, yet with the glow squid they'll be perfect for builds and just give the ocean that little kick! אהה אני צולל די הרבה. משום מה הרבה חושבים שסקווידוויד הוא תמנון 🐙 כי מעטים מבדילים בין דיונון 🦑 לתמנון 🐙 ואני יכול להבין למה. אבל אלא חיות אחרות וגל להבדיל בינהם במים. סקווידוויד הוא דיונון (squid) ולא תמנון (octopus) 普通で良いので、太刀魚釣りたかったです（笑） だけどあれは凄かった♪ Squid or anything grey. maybe a baby squid I believe calling them a kid then a squid was a marketing tactic for shits and giggles plus so they could use the song for their trailers, i liked it. But inklings sound better I refuse to add another mountain hazard and the moobloom just seems boring. I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm unironically voting glow squidlike bitch these are my after school treats. he hesitated to pull out the dried squid like “this one might be too much” but that. was my favourite snack. i just. what was the point. what building inspiration would the whites be getting from fish and wasabi peas. I'll be so upset if the Iceologer wins the vote! I'm voting for Moobloom, but if the squid wins I won't be too mad lol The plastic, it’s too much plastic, even the ocean doesn’t have that much plastic. Not to mention the ink. If every squid in the world got together they wouldn’t produce enough ink to match that Is that the new gacha vote for moobloom or glow squid It's like a mild annoyance damn them *shakes fist at not saving a few squid* 😂 thinking about how that episode in particular, while trying to be emblematic of unionists, essentially mocked and trivialized them, and squid and Bob ended up just working for free for eternity Maybe not the best lookAs plain as the glow squid may seem it would be such a beautiful addition to the aquatic aspect of the game It's not that easy to choose the mobs though the mobs aren't that good this time around but based on what is given to us they come in very close but I will choose glow squid. uranium squid bro! 川が綺麗になるとアサリとれないんだ people voting squid over moobloom are sad, they would rather have a useless mob than a mob that at least has some functionality '' I'm FINE! '' There he went, tempered lashing out with a frustrated tone. Fingers dug into his jacket as he avoided eye contact with the pink squid. hey Ernie. It's me, Squid! Here's the People's Assembly Twitter I was telling you about.  Mads Mikkelsen and a Giant Squid The Iceloger is coming out in this vote to complement the snow-capped mountain update, squid and cow don't paint anything in this update 13 including the free space. (I included squid under octopus) hold up is this the descendant of the squid thing in the other mob vote???? Paul Rudd Giant Squid Just over a week I think , raised the bed, moved storage underneath and gave the dogs half , cladded 2 walls because one was falling apart , squid painted those walls so 1 wall left to paint ... oh and I did the floor 😁 おやありでしたー!! とやま…(ﾎﾞｿｯ Florence Pugh Vs Giant Squid in a super queer retelling of 20,000 leagues under the sea. 😂希乃:ネット年齢制限がどうとか言ってるけど、子供に使わせるパソコンにはフィルタリングソフト入れたほうがいいと思う。そして子供がそれを突破する技術を持ち始めたら、プロキシサーバにSquidを噛ませて…とレベルアップしていけば高校生になる頃にはサーバー管理者。 It’s amazing how much a simple image can say. Glad, whoever the prince squid is, has gotten sober. I like the flower cow but I at least think that the glow squid is better than that other t h i n g MY SQUID, ily forever ever ❤️ 50 years corruption. A little over 3.5 years to investigate? When directors of FBI/CIA and many others were co conspirators? When some were/are the most powerful people in the WORLD? Oh yeah, and a whole lot of crooked lawyers! The biggest squid with the most tentacles ever? いく!!!!!かさいのじかんになったら 連絡させて😭😭😭 I'M SO GLAD IT GOT THERE SAFELY much like real squid migrate thousands of kms through the mighty seaEm quem que vc vai votar na ? 1-moobloom 2-iceologer 3-glow squid This guy might be onto something. I’ve had turtle, pigeon, kangaroo, swordfish and squid too! Oh and snails! Ok but the squid fella is also hella cute じゃあぼくはETCのピッ！！っていう音の役やりますので帯同させてくださいWhile inklings are mere squid, I must say, they are extremely fashionable.Ennui squid wolf cornhole blog master cardigan helvetica. epcot magickingdom 僕事故っちゃいます🥺 ねむよう💤 Your Really Reaching with this oneSquid Sisters - Ink Me Up (Aimol Localisation)🌟We're getting to the end, Squids 💕 So proud of myself🌟 They do only spawn in flower biomes but I still agree, I'm voting glow squid despite how everyone seems to want the iceologer Thank you so much squid, it's been an amazing birthday!guys if you haven’t listened to `squid melody, blue version` you’re literally missing out 厳しいね…The Glow squid will be one of the first mobs in minecraft to produce light and plus he looks so cool  Pillow is from wish I genuinely think it cost £1 and the skull is squids from her far cry 5 ... so I can do the pillow lol Fighter and the squid im gonna say it. what does the piss cow and squid does. nothing, what does the villiager do. usees ice I was forced to dissect a frog and a squid. It made me really sad. The squid also smelled like ass and chemicals. Pillowfort was nice. I didn’t get 20 likes like I do on Instagram using a ton of tags, but it was nice to get likes at all. It’s a smaller site, so likes felt personal. Instagram seems to be just “empty likes” and comments for pages advertising follower buying. The squids were really cool. They have crystals in their eyes that we kept and took home. And we wrote our names on paper using their cartilage as a pen dipped in their ink sac. Looking back it was metal af 🤣🤣🤣Ia começar go go squid, mas como eu sei q irei surtar assistindo a ponto de não superar q nem the king's avatar, irei começar outro cdrama 🤡🤡🤡 That could really be said for any of these mobs really. i.e if the squid came out in the ocean update, or if the iceologer came out in the villager update.me, slapping my dm with an entire side story i wrote for my character and momo: give her back to me you squid You YEETED a filet of SQUID at my FACE The comments are starting to look more like the moobloom and glow squid voters teamed up vs the iceologer voters. ill kill itSpicy Squid Black Sesame Salmon 🗣🍴 We did squids in elementary school (3rd grade) Frogs in middle school (8th grade) Pigs in High school (11th grade) I have almost no ninja squid gear. 😏 They’re all reskins Squid with glow Cow with flower Illiger with ice i mean yeah but its either that or useless cow or a shiny squid Squid-U-Like..? This Mob Is Best :DDDDDDDDD Plz Win Glow SquidEu votaria na Glowing Squid fodase Especially when someone gets hit by a boat Wait im confusing myself with an anime Iceoliger, why? Because glowing squid and moobloom exist in Minecraft Earth already god No thank you... you’re a squid You know what the cow and squid drop in MCe, ink sacs the squid and the cow leather and meat, in dungueons the drops a ice wand, imagine having one of those in the game 🙁😥 no we are not. we are not. but we have to keep our heads high. So you prefer a squid reskin over a new mob with a unique attack. Please explain? ill protecc 諦めたんですねなるほど yes i am squid mommy Ok I’m all for iceolager it is moobloom actually least favourite? I mean our regular squids suck Crispy duck salad / duck spring rolls, salt pepper squid, Crispy seaweed to start. Merlot beef, Spiced crispy Chicken, spicy prawns with rice Singapore Noodles. Washed down with Asahi a flaggon of wine. かわ、えっちち♥️ Think I'm gonna go for the glow squid for this one I like aquatic stuff If they literally added a hypno effect it'd likely force the player to look at the glow squid, but that's me speculating.. But if I'm right, This mob would be an absolute pain in the *ass*, especially when fighting some Drowned. :/Remember when "I wish squids were real" was the peak of comedy in Splatoon i.m now the glow squid A cow found in a rare biome, that seems to interact with another mob, interesting. Makes the reproduction advancement harder. Maybe get honey in a bucket Cool squid that adds light to oceans, seems to have some hostile hypnotic interaction Some dude throwing ice Glowsquid is the obvious right choice. There are other cow and illager variants, but no more than one type of squid And if it wasn't for the creative industry and the vastly talented professionals, London 2012 Olympics would have been pretty shit and a damp squid help this industry out before it's too late. No im so done with this mob vote. Not you of course, but this has passed me off. Now im supposed to vote for the iceologer cause the glow squid really is useless. God damn this years shitty mob vote Again not ur fault klouver "stole"? it'll still be in MCE. i play MCE too and i'd rather have the Moobloom or Glow Squid win than the boring Iceologer. Nice hat squid!!8 Frick the squid お久しぶりですー！またふじけんさんと3人で焼肉行きたいですね〜(*´ω`)ﾉ I like the glow squid5 he is not just some cow or squid clone thats does something slightly different dudes really voting for another illager when you can get A GLOW IN THE DARK SQUID OOO IM GLAD ,, IM DOING RLLY WELL TY !! VOTE FOR MOOBLOOMS! They are useful in farming because of their relationship with the bees! Reasons: Moobloom is useful in farming Can be used to attract bees Iceloger freezes you Glow squid hypnotises you! You would drown! virus (?) / squid / butterfly / caterpillar / genes / flower / whale / flower / strawberry / pear / red / yoyo / basketball / pill / tube (?) / temperature (?) / (brass) bell / baseball / 8ball / balloon / present / whale / soccer ball / apple juice / banana / football Devour Felixx is not a big squid white people CAN be racially discriminated against. If I was in a room full of black guys, would it be okay for them to call me a cracker? Now, if I am in a room full of a random assortment of people, is it now okay for them to call me a cracker? Racism exists for all people. Im fine with either the iceologer or the moobloom, glow squids on the other hand im probably the least interested in. Atleast they look cool... wouldnt glowsquid be the more pointless one? its just a squid fine ill hug myself HIIII HOW R U Watch the squid and the whale if you get a chance, that's an interesting watch Minecraft: I know we promised all these good features but were all busy animating an animation for squidier squids Do vote for Glow Squid tho ninjala is the kid without squid wtf shawn i MISS YOUR MITSURI 🤩🤩🤩 ill be shinobu to ur giyuu and hug you ooc 🥺 bc shinobu wouldnt be caught dead doing so It might be tho :0 People are going to vote for the squid and completely regret it because it’s useless I want him now Frick the squid and the moo shroom cloneHotaru ika (ホタルイカ): Firefly squid 69bca1324f264bc5baaeb21155a2d540 I cant decide! Moobloom for farming? Glow squid for Asthetics? Or Iceloger for survivalEver since we arrived at the east coast my meals have been: Breakfast - black coffee Elevenses - chips Lunch - chips with salt and vinegar Mid aft - crispy battered squid Dinner - fish and chips. 🤘🏻 Hehe! I think with you as Callie, then I should be Marie! We can be the Squid Sisters! that squid ward is so hd 🕵️ I will be fair and say the mountain illager would be the most game changing But at the same time most people hate fucking illagers so second best to me is the cow due to the fact it interacts with another mob in a unique way Squid just sucks tho lmao I MADE THATTTTSQUID JERKY IS A THING AND NO ONE TOLD ME :(Ok listen.. Glow Squids probably will drop glow stuff. Glowsticks. THROWABLE GLOWSTICKS.  MY FUCKING THUMBNAIL glow squid: SHINY moobloom: we already have a mooshroom, why not make it a pig or something chillager: cold pillager Why have the squid when you can't spend "hours" underwater. Unless creative. Iceologer I can see better. Though I don't explore enough. Brilliant, Squid is the best fish sauce, no question! 🥰🥰🥰 glow squids are just gonna be like taiga biome update where people voted for foxes because they were cute See. That's a misconception. They haven't announced features of the glow squid or moobloom yet. i accidentally voted for glow squid im iceologer The glowing squid is the best wat it moobloom and chillagers The frick is a squid? Are they a type of bed sheet? Squid ward!!! The Iceologer adds a challenge to the mountains, glowsquids are just reskinned squidsi wish squids were realif yall dont vote for mooblooms, we cant be friends. if you vote glow squid, youre on thin ice. and if you vote iceologer its ON SIGHT Hachi giggled as Red did that but he was also beginning to lose balance "Easy easy, im gonna fall over" In minecraft dungueons he drops an ice wand, the squid in arth drops -6 ink sacsDo you want the same old squid just glowy, ANOTHER pillager, or A WONDETRFUL LOVING BEE FRIENDING FLOWER COW? The choice is obvy. Pick piss cow. That's good, squid's aren't what they were, allowing for inflation you could easy add a few tuna and a cod, but get change from seal👍😜 What about that description screams ‘annoying’ to you? If it’s well balanced, it will be fine. Besides, it’s better than a useless squid. the ice boy or glow squid should win oh it is a squid-squid is performative Glow squid gang Nah, they are all Biden voters This is pure speculation. Don’t vote based off of non-confirmed information. Also, you claimed that the iceologer would be annoying. If looking at the squid would make you freeze and drown, that would be even worse! SQUID Ngl it seems kinda useless same with the squid. Sounds a lot like a corporation trying to squeeze more out of their workers without compensating them for it 💁🏻‍♂️ Chilli squid for me 😍 Glow squid is so cool, nonw of these movs add much to the game but the glow squid looks really cool and adds epic ambience Nah I did this in highschool too. They use whole frozen squidI'm at the motherfucking Blast pit level and fuck that squid tentacle thing man That is also another reason why I'm voting squid. The Chillager sounds cool at first, but then you have to remember what Mojang's done in the past and what's more likely to happen. The Chillager probably won't be an important mob in the game, but who knows, they could surprise us This Happened because She basically got Told off and Now She is having a tantrum. Im suprised isnt trending Put the Phone down and walk away or just admit your Wrong. Its not difficult🤷‍♂️ gn squid !! way ahead of you :P ngl i hate that this means the iceologer is probably going to win because its literally the worst choice of the three, the mooblooms have a good bit of potential with bees and at least the glow squids might be cool as far as im concerned the iceologer is the only wrong choice. Smoke em if ya got em.Gobramax is a vast patchwork of squid, sealion and combine harvester. He draws his power from pineapples. glow squids are just gonna be like taiga biome update where people voted for foxes because they were cutethey should make a Madame Tussaud’s of just YouTubers Like a section for gaming: dantdm, Stampy, squid, Ali a Groups: sidemen, dude perfect Then like irl/vloggers: joe sugg, zoella And pewdiepie in his own section. Also maybe music ppls? Not Ksi bc he’d be with sdmn but yea LOVE it!  The second one is a squid. Right? Omg yes please! Yes it is! I had to decide between Quidophilus, QD, or Squid!just had the best chilli squid ever I’m just hoping that before the final votes are in for the first round they go a bit more into what each mob has to offer. The Glow Squid has so much more potential than the normal Squid but for now it really isn’t offering much. Glow squid might glow squids are just gonna be like taiga biome update where people voted for foxes because they were cute glow squid Drink glow squid cum and you glow in caves 👌👌👌 How do glowing squids affect the game? They literally can't work due to a lack of dynamic lighting.Glow squid: potentially more widespread pufferfish, maybe slows you causing you to drown Moobloom: less rare mooshroom Chillager: an mob for a place that didn’t even have any unique hostile mobs, badass ability, great addition to the pillager family don't kind yourself pal, write back when you've published something more on the level of "Ambushed (My Lover is an Alien Squid, - Gay Tentacle) Kindle Edition" First impression: A NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHES Your nickname in my head: Squid Closeness ratings [1-10]: 8 You are my: First fan!

Dammit I really hope they add dynamic lighting just to make the squids actually glow. this joke about voting for squid is no longer being so funny the glow squid also hypnotizes youTHIS OCTOBER 3RD VOTE SQUID  Mesmo eu achando que o mago neria na teoria melhor, eu prefiro que a glow squid vença, PQ? Simples, como na ultima votação onde escolhemos o mob mais daora (Phantom) nós cometemos uma mega burrada, logo não duvido que esse mago vire uma praga insuportavel, ent melhor nem votar... Two squid EW.... Guys go draw tubbo like squid ward '' ( Ugh..... ) What're you doing around here, huh?

Its not a gift. 🤷‍♂️ Hachi kept petting her, he even gave her a kiss on the forehead Yes me 🙋🏻‍♀️They’re rigging the election against glow squid. They released them 2 days after the other two and repeatedly say “don’t vote” for the squid 🙄 while saying “this is so cute vote for this cutie” for the moobloom 🙄🙄🙄 Yeah, if someone called me a cracker I'd be laughing too hard to be offended by it piss cow can wait we can form piss squid All done count me in please 🤞🏻🥰 Yes everyone can be oppressed due to different circumstances, but for a white person race is not a cause for that oppression. White people cannot face racism because the system we live under was built by white people, in benefits us. You can experience prejudices, but not racism 🗿 I'm going with Iceologer, though I wouldn't be mad if glow squid won, I'm intrigued by the trailer for it But glow squid : Cheers. Disagree re: Squid Lord. No other complaints 😊Iceologer would be second least common. Glow squid would be seen the most easily! I dont think id remember iceologers that much and if i did see them just randomly, its weird seeing random illagers, and if it is a structure, thats okay but rarer! The vampire squid losing tentacles 🦑squid tiddies It sucks, cause' it had tons of potential. It could have hypnotized you and drug you down similar to Mob A from the 2017 vote, it could've dropped some kinda glowy ink you could apply to leather clothes and see in the dark, But they instead choose to make… A squid… That glows…I will pen you a thank-you note. With paper I will make from fresh pulp. With a feather plucked from a goose. And ink squeezed from a squid. They Just hope For No Pokemon Rep. How is that being a Whiny Brat? 🤔 "Shhhhh, relax" I KNOW RIGHT but specially sploon players cause like.... there’s a whole arc about authoritarism and things in funny squid game Idek man it bothers me that stupid people play sploon 😳 Basically anything with Jar Jar or Padme ... or The Squid rings Moving underwater lanterns. I’m voting for the squid Cracker’s origin, if I remember correctly, is from the term whip cracker, aka the people who were harming the slaves and “cracking the whip” who were, for the most part, whiteIf you don’t vote flow squid, we can’t be friends The squid and cow are pretty bad tbh doesnt the glow squid put you in a trance or something..? Nice I love beach episodes yush! owowowo i mean piss cow is cute and all but can you imagine? just this underwater base that would be all dark by itself, but then BAM glowing squids everywhere, just moving lights just outside of the glass deadass 😳😳  We ain’t getting no magic want what the hell you talking about squids drop ink tho It's striking though how often these things overlap. Just now someone decided in their squid party that it was okay to try to splat me since I was painting/trying to play the actual game, and the one time they got me 5 people squidbagged me. Oh. She just got the best news ever with that nod. Eight's now going to lightly spin her squid around in a loving hug. Good thing her chest covered the blushing. "Oh...my cod you're the best, Three~! My hearts are beating so much right now!" It's true, Three could hear it. The squid can possibly hypnotized the player..The moobloom is a boring flower cow The glow squid is a funny fishie that GLOWS and is really cute and it would make the ocean look more interestingPlease guys the glow squid is so much cooler than the moobloom owo! the qt fwend? owowo!PHILZA WANTS THE GLOW SQUID TOO!!!!! BIG BRAIN Exactly. Since they already have squids and mooshrooms, it wouldn’t be hard at all. The I solo her would probably be the hardest to code, and even then, probably not *that* hard.you're a kid now! you're a squid now! We Get It you like Gen 8, Most people have there opinions remember🤪 What you do with the time is a sperate issue, for sure. I vote for either moobloom or iceologer but dang was looking forward to something better than a glow squid Yeah but the post was stating villagers to. Which means he was wrong. If he meant illagers id understand, but there is only one squid so Biden was what I thought he would be, weak but he did have a few good moments. Trump was crying for the whole time but what else is new. Still I’m  That is exactly what I'm thinkin, if we get a new item or weapon or something worth the time I'd be fully down, but judging from all three mobs theyve shown and how minor of the addition of a new mob is i doubt well get anything like that, which is why i want squidAre you guys going to watch this year? If you are, which mob are you voting? Me personally, I think it is gonna be cool if the Iceologer wins because it will be the first mob from MC Dungeons in normal MC, but the Glow Squid also looks pretty cool, so it is a tie. THANK YOU DUDE!!!what is glow squid yush w In this hypothetical scenario that these squids do hypnotize players it wouldnt be for forever, it's like having an enemy having no cooldown timer to attacks, like if skeletons fired bows like miniguns thanks dude!! ✨ thankies w "With a little practice you'll be able to be scary" He continued to pet Red thank youuuu!! ^w^Wait holy shit,,, imagine endlantis with glow squids It adds challenge to mountains. The squid has no use. THATS WHAT I SAID BUT NOooOOO people like SQUID GLOW SQUID SUPREMACY :)I'm voting glow squid, why? I don't want a cow or another stupid illager, I want the G L O Wglow squids are literally useless AND they don’t even glow mooblooms piss cows with buttercups and only exist in another rare biome ice illagers are just more illagers what the hell are you going to do with those thanks mojang! pois tem chances de tu gostar de go go squidThe amounts of people that want to vote for the glow squid are alarming I love the glow squid too :) The chilli squid in wagamama is beautiful. Just saying. What is so good about the iceologer nothing... the glow squids would be cool for the dark parts of the ocean go ahead ou go go squid (tu gostou do love 020?) Little squid I don't see how this is an unpopular opinion though. I would extend it to more obvious forms of griefing or, more generally, having 'fun' at the expense of others' ability to enjoy the game. (Squid parties or sabotaging Salmon Runs, etc...) El Glowing Squid no serviría como lámpara,su brillo va a ser igual al de los ojos de los enderman,es decir,se pueden ver incluso en oscuridad total pero no iluminan como tal. Imahine votijg buseles squid He giggled instead of a scream "You're just to cute to be Scary" But you need to do the same if glow squid ok ??? AS HE SHOULD YOU KNOW HOW GOOD THE END REALM WOULD LOOK WITH GLOW SQUID? Pope nomination when?👀 😂😂😂Glow squid all I might be drawing a whole lot of unimpressed giant squid this month. We’ll see how unimpressed he can get.PHIL SAID GLOW SQUID 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔 i can't find it AHHHHH but it's wilbur's squid song if you remember it from the fundy wilbur collab video It would be nice if since you need ink to write books for enchantments if the squid somehow made them better I mean the squid looks cool, but it won’t add anything. The Moobloom will be too difficult to find(in flower forest)and by the time you find it, you probs won’t need it. But the Iceologer is like a mini boss that adds to the mountain update, and with a unique attack+drops ice?! "big and scary girl yes you are"Sorry but in this household we stan glow squid and if you don't agree I'm going to have to ask you politely to leave. GLOW SQUID FOR THE FORKING WIN glow squid im with phil squid NO GLOW SQUID GANG Glow squid SQUID !! OCEANS ARE SO BORING !! WE NEED NEW SHINY !! Glow squid boisss,  It's racist to judge someone positively OR negatively based on their race. they won't complain if you're talking positively because they're x or y race but it's not the race that causes them to be anything. It is just the person they are.squid使ってHTTPのプロキシさせようとしたけど、apacheのmod_proxy使ったほうが早い気がしてきた The squids don’t glow...? Seems Mooblooms and Chillagers have taken the lead. 👀 he said 'spare a thought for the squids' Just play the other games The glow squid don’t actually glow. they aren’t a light source, because there’s no dynamic lighting. In the Minecraft blog it talks about the glow as “enderman eyes” as they appear to glow in the dark. There’s no use to the retextured squid besides looking kind of cool Lamest mob tfw when the acolyte becomes a priestVoting Glow Squid bc squids have been out for ages and need a new species, Mooblooms are cute but there are 2 cow species in minecraft already (Cow and Mooshroom), Mooblooms can be added in next time. Chillagers are just no. Glow squid gang Squid....... i barely go underwater and the illager looks ugly so by elimination i’d choose the cow since it’s actually cute too while the squid i’ve heard doesn’t even glow He kissed her cheek and began to pet herfundy just saved a squid why is be so adorable aawww🥺🥺 I wonder if the glow squid will be like an endermen but just non hostile Maybe I could lock you in place for 5 seconds if you look at it That would be bad for people with no bubbleshow can you not stan fundy? he just pushed a squid who was out of water into the water instead of letting it die :))He really turned around to save the squid, yesssFUNDY BEING FRIENDLY TO A SQUID??!? LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  It seems that possible when you look at a glow squid too long you may get a new nausea type effect. squid.. baby "Ok big girl" イカ氏の家って有刺鉄線の中にあるの？ デスマッチ開催かな？ I was leaning cow as they mentioned there was going to be a unique interaction with bees, however I saw someone mention squid could lead to new ink color drop... so I am being swayed. Squid on a box What he do? Fabulous Apron and great Fish Sauce 😊😋🏅🏆 Mooblooms are for pollination, at least they do something that helps the player, unlike the squid who does literally nothing. Regarding the Iceologer, yeah, it sucks. Do the glow squid Goes to show you’re a very good teacher Uhhhhhh.....I'm sure that chick who had the live squids up his ass would be down for this...Squid played one game against my Yoshi and leftglow squid is the only answer and the correct answer vote for glow squid  The squid won’t even glow lol oh please ur probably gonna vote for a squid that doesn’t even glow and a cow with flowers on it It’s funny. Please fucking laugh nowSon beats me again in quiz 🙈 1. He gave me a Squid, I answered Octopus. He slammed me a ❌ 2. Gave me a Sloth (I no even sabi am before sef) I called it a koala 🙄. I missed in 3 attempts. Wetin man no know, e no know! Need to borrow myself brain b4 playing this game again. b r u h okay as much as I like the glow squid cause I just like glowing things like that, especially in wildlife, I'd really just have to go for the Moobloom hereIdk if i want to vote for the glow squid or the iceologer :/ True and if the slim chance glow squid wins can't wait to see what people make cows ARE cute but i love squids deeply please tell me y’all are voting moobloom or glow squid. And the glow squid is just a glowing squid. It doesn’t even add anything new and we got an aquatic update bigger than village and pillage. Iceologers will give u a reason to explore the mountainsI'm thinking out of the meh choices... Glowing Squids win. Finally a different squid. We have 3 different cows already, and we have different illagers. Cows would just give us another yellow flower... and the ice illager sounds really annoying. But Im all for more light sources! Moobloom: interacts with bees in some way or another Iceologer/chillager: adds a unique new gameplay mechanic as well as an interesting hostile mob for the mountains Glow squid: glows sad, i wanted Moobloom to win, but it doesn't look like it stands a chance. i mean i'll be happy if Glow Squid wins too, but i don't want the Iceologer. it's just another villager/illager/pillager, except this time it's cold. 頑張って😚💪 vamos unete a la glow squid gang no temas i mean honestly with things as they are i can no longer imagine a future i do NOT spend under the sea with my squid family? I think it can also be cont y môr, can’t it? Or is that squid? Incidentally, jellyfish in Irish is smugairle róin (pronounced a bit like smuggerly roan): seal snot! Doctor Squid Gin. Comes in a really cool copper jar. Its black and when you add tonic water it turns pink. Cuddles the Squid "Come here-"OH! And is going to be celebrating her birthday on MFC tonight, so be sure to go celebrate with her! ❤️ Squid. 😳 I’m sorry but Glow Squid is the one true answer. I literally cannot see the use in moobblooms and as for the iceologers... I don’t want to repeat the same mistake that we had with the phantom. It’s just going to be an annoying mob. Sorry, I don't feel disappointed. Not everything has been told yet. Also, things can change over time. As for me, Glow Squid is still the best.Please, don't vote for any mobe just because of speculation, there is not glowy dye or hipnotic effect confirmed for the squid, there is not ice wand confirmed for iceologer, and there is not new flower, new soup or new drops, please, vote for confirmed information  Vengeance is a dish best served with squid ink, Lebanese Arak and wine. 🤔Squids are such majestic creatures Idk I'm torn between iceologer and glow squid. If no new info then I'm voting iceologer but if they say anything else I might changeIs anyone else questioning whether the submarine was just part of the Glow Squid announcement or if it's going to come with the Glow Squid...  The squid looks cool but the cow looks cuter imo And honestly if neither of them do anything I’d rather have a cow that does nothing apart from be friends with bees than a squid that does nothing apart from glow I can't get over the black cheese and using squid ink. It probably tastes nothing like squid but now the thought is in my mind so now I can't do it... urswould b skittles or squid. why the fuck is pink always I WANNA MAKE OUT WITH YOU AND LIVE TOGETHER like some of us have squid sisters disease and immediately pair green with pink without reading id like to not d*e bro imagine the fucking oceans at night with glowy squid why u voting a white supremacist throwing ice at you Glow squid, I love the idea of mobs that light up the area, imagine map maker's making glow squids for light then making them invisible. Also I think deep oceans need a bit more atmosphere and a glow squid would be really cool. we have cow varients we have illager varients No squid varients!! SQUID!!!!! SQUID GANGstarting to think of new options for my life, like dwelling in the sea and speaking only to squid what does the squid even do, I like it cause glowy but like, does it even have a use, or is it just thereThe squids house instead of brain there is squid sisters2 it gives the squids some love But what about those who build glow squid or that cow can bring 1 block glow could bring a semi luminescent block ( which should be very nice for builds) and the cow may bring more flowers. We already have like 6 villager variants "Does the little squiddy need some cuddles-?"Jardon: ice villager! Kara: glowing squid! That means that the piss cow must win nowMy reasons why you should vote glow squid 7 bands (taking the lead from Chops, after waking up to 24 notifications 😉) Silverbacks Squid Sweater Curse Spitwash Pip Blom The Goon Sax The Wedding Present i have squid sisters diseaseGuys so what if i made another persona thing but it’s just my regular one but with quackity’s LAFD beanie and tommy’s shirt but it has like squid kid’s flower thing GUYS I CAN BE THE ULTIMATE SIMP. I will draw this rn /srsPLEASE DON'T vote for the Glow Squid. It does NOT emit light. It's "glow" is like the Enderman's eyes. Just go on the official Minecraft website read about it. Count me in please  squid is super funny i wish i saw them on my tl more has nice hair Like you said they are just hints so nothing confirmed yet. Don't get me wrong it will be absolutely awesome if glow squids actually do that. I would prefer glow squid over moobloom but I think I might vote for iceologer. everyone can be oppressed, given circumstance. Racism is not specifically against a minority either. Racism is discrimination or judgement of someone based on their race or ethnicity. It is TYPICALLY against minorities, however anyone can be discriminated against for their skin. I like the squid tbh SQUID SQUAD! Do you want a glowing squid or flower cow more?stupid squid don't even give off light.  おやありしたーヾ(oﾟωﾟo)ﾉﾞ So are Minecraft squids oomf squid is really cool!!!! they have a really cool layout idk I kinda like that squid glows pretty cool and also it's an opportunity to add glowsticks, colored/underwater torches and glow wooli vote the glow squid Bro it literally shoots you off the damn top of the mountains you will get sick and tired of it fast, the glow squid adds a new nice touch to the dark parts of the ocean cause they actually glow and also we might get more than just glowing squids possibly goggles or something sorry im voting for the glowing squid As I said, it's a mob vote, not a vehicle vote. Maybe they will add it, even if the glowing squids doesn't win, as it's not related with the mob vote. But I doubt they will do it. Minecraft squid La vaca estaría chetada por la sopa de saturación y el mago estaría cheto para granjas de hielo, mejor el glow squid que es bonico But the glow squids are funny Lmao yeah if they gave us more info I wouldn’t be so quick to dismiss the other mobs but rn the others are just retextured mooshrooms and squids while the chillager seems like an interesting mob w a unique attackAnd finding the exact location with a Rocket Squid? Horrendous, even though it doesn't necessarily die unlike the Eye of Ender. After the 1.16.2 port I'm going to have to rethink locating statues - maybe more common statues, or an easier process. Suggestions welcome. I’m assuming it works like a Mesmer in subnautica. That or it’s just a new squid variant that looks cool. I’m just hoping the squid ink is special thought it was supposed to be a squid till i read the replies ??? Ya pas de logique But I want the glow squid :( squid fica em ultimo e mago ganha squids need smth new and i dont want another villager mob 💀 Because who the actual hell wouldnt want a glowing g squid or a yellow mushroom? Who? life is a big fight and we all in it, the key is to never give up. keep up fighting bro 👊 did anyone watch the video? who wants to to die of drowning because of a squid?nb names be like “toast” “key” “squid” and honestly it’s a vibe 🤣🤣 I was like "The Glow Squid"?!?! Perfect for hubby !! I just LOVE having ten limbs in squid form. I couldn't live without a single one! GLOW SQUID SUPREMACY The three of them are just new textures, but Chillager has a cape so... Disco-ball squid for me Yo basically. Imagine something glowing and a squid if you dont want it block me yeah, in my opinion, squids are easily the best from this mob vote. I would be okay with the iceologer winning, but if that honey cow wins, I'm gonna be really pissed *OT4'Diary of a School Nurse' - this is... very odd. A bit of rom, a bit com, huge amounts of slime, slime demons, teenagers, flesh tentacles, ghosts (slime), mass hysteria, supernatural dumbo squid, and teachers. Only six episodes. A haunted school series focusing on the staff. A+ it hypnotizes you, brightens the ocean and can potentially drown you, if you vote the glow squid people might stop complaining about the phantom. but really idk the iceologer seems like a better choice Sorry bro but I'm going for glow squid Its too epicThe only saving grace for these squid rings were that they included fried tentacles. The batter was almost nonexistent and overall Not Good™ season 4 should add move mermaids from different countries they swim from. Different transformations and eye colors new enemies they're facing. Dangerous creatures from the sea giant squid, octopus and great white shark. Maybe add alien mermaids from other planets. Because squids are useless unless you need ink illagers give emeralds some give potions and the totem of undying, the cows are a good food source and help with potion effects You want another stupid squid he doesn't even drop anything new But what if I decided to mix it up today and simply feed you squid ink pasta.Glow Squid is also cute thounpopular opinion but the glowing squid thing won’t be cool. it’ll probably just be annoying. we don’t need another hostile mob. vote for yellow cow 2020 yes Oh wow definitely gonna vote for a squid that just glows or a flower cow how exciting cant wait it would be so fun to just stare at and nothing else cause its just there for decoration I'm stuck between voting for the glowsquid and the moobloom 🤔 I'm a builder, so the combat the iceologer provides means nothing to me. If anything, it would be annoying, since I like building in the mountains. Both the squid and the cow would be great for aethect building,Guys please vote for the glow squid they’re so coolPar contre c’est bon, on a déjà assez de Illager/Types de villageois, J’espère vraiment que le Glow Squid gagnera !! :( 1) Squid is a woman. 2) No one sends anyone to you. 3) The mascots are not real, but the people they're modelled after are real. oh I miscounted lmao sorry I’ve had some ideas for how the glow squid could work and I’ve posted them on the Minecraft suggestions page. I don’t really know how Twitter works, but I can give you the link if you’d like! glow squid is F tier. So this what happened to Shima's during her disappearance. Ah, being in a bit of a tied up situation with a sand squid. Well that solves this long mystery. :) I’m voting for the glow squid. Moobloom feels like they are just copying the mooshroom and while the iceilliger seems cool I don’t want to deal with another hostile mob that’s is only going to be annoying with 0 good drops. Oh, and there’s the presidential election too I guess. hi squid! do you take constructive criticism on your tweets? Must be written by a Squid That's the rumour anyway, squid. All matches are cancelled and training in groups of 15 which I'd imagine would be too much hassle. I could be wrong, though I don't care for the glow squid. The moobloom doesn't seem too bad, but I'm gonna vote for the Chillager I feel that specially when I'm in the crib alone and the homies aren't there We have well over 10 different villager/illager/pillager varients. We have 3 cow and 1 squid. The glowsquid is the ONLY fully glowing and animated mob that would be added. Animated textures are rare to come by and on a mob that's crazy Ooooh .... would love this seasoning and apron to use! 😀vote glowy squid. Imagine the Glow Squid with RTX. If Glow Squid fails, then Iceologer is my second pick.Spread the word! The glow squid could be amazing if these ideas get heard! all the better to see your favorite new minecraft mob, the glow squid.Who doesn't like the Glow Squid? Chill Dude over The Light Bulb Squid! After one team gets eliminated and there are two left, you should vote for squid but only if the moobloom doesn’t make it Idk man I think a glowing squid would be really cool glow squid for smash bros Parang gusto ko ulit panoorin ang go go squid Definitely! The squid is hypnotic So tell me about this video game; squid splash toon False! It adds a squid. I agree tho the squid does look kinda pretty You know I was in the Navy with Hammer. Moffett Field Ca late 70s. He was just another squid kid. The squid hypnotizes peoplewho are you gonna be voting for in the mob vote? Glow Squid: like a mesmer from subnautica, appears to have a distraction ability Moobloom: is friends with bees :D and is the 4th variation of the cow Iceologer: yet another villager/illager/pillager variant, has ice cloud attacks Also a great guide for “what to buy at H Mart” - I’m totally trying the squid peanut snacks now. Squid: new concept of lighting Moobloom: unique interaction with other mob Iceologer: annoying attack which might ruin the mountain updateI’m just gonna say it I hate squids with a passion and I don’t care if they were removed from the game, I’d much rather have a retextured cow than a retextured squid. That’s my opinion please don’t beat meArrrr! Give me back me puffle ye scoundrel squid! voting glow squid cuz the ocean needs more pazaaz Lol what I've seen a lot of defenses for the glow squid but you just made all of those things up Yeah but Glowing squid 🥺i cant believe i barely got out of online classes and its not even 1 pm yet pls mom/squid makes it feel like its fucking midnight and i havent sleptMinfilia had the penis of a squid, the pee-pee of a frog, and the kneecap of a politician. 1. Neither do this 2. Just an example (They had an glowing squid in terraria I think..?) 3. No they weren't, the squids were normally above the water or a just a little deep 4. Iceologer is more thing to the update 5. yeaSquid Sisters - City of Color (Badimaya Localisation) When did I ever say Minecraft was just about survival? Geez dude, you keep making things up out of nowhere. I said that Glow Squids wouldn't just be useless to survival players, but many other types of players as well. Never wanted to hurt the guy’s feelings. Just wanted to have an argument with him about why I personally think the glow squid isn’t the best option. I still had fun discussing why I think the glow squid isn’t the best choice tho! Np! Ok, yeah... Well... Tgen I say Angel is a hairy nipple しかも太くてヒキは楽しめます………boyfriend and squid dad are gonna be cat maids for halloween who's gonna be a cat maid next me??? Wholesome, like "destroying other dimensions together" "him being her bottom" 3 1. not all of them have enough potential 2. I could agree on guardiana, but like... skeletons? It's like a skeleton from any different game 3. squids are hard to notice, and this one will be easy 4. mountains also will be updated 5. 5th of pros: 'glowing, not lighting' Honestly, I'm voting for the squid, only because cows have 4 variants, Illagers have 3 or 4, but there is only one type of squid. bro I posted this before the squid video came out OMG CONGRATS YOU TWO!!!!!!!! nohc, watching the news: some idiot tried to fight a squid at the aquarium he xuan, drenched in ink: maybe the squid was being a dickkinda wanna have a glow squid layout now..... Btw, are they all coming to Minecraft at some point? After watching the Glow Squid video... I'm honestly divided between Chillager and Glow Squid now.vote for glow squid. i do not take criticism because i am right. you're wrong because us casual players dont want to get rekt gathering snow xD glow squid in the deep oceans tho, those would be cool af The glow squid will hypnotize people and I don’t know what that means but it sounds really cool"In any case, it is urgent to choose: either the human being and his future or octopuses and squids. More than optimism, I feed the hope that we will create judgment and learn to be wise." We've had our chance, let the squids have a turn. If you really want the glowsquid that much, you could just use a texture pack only with the glowsquid textures replacing the normal squid ones. Thats all you need cuz they're that similar. Plus, the illagers are like the big overworld villains the iceologer has good features. its 30th of sep 8:27pm for me waaaaa "The glow in Glow Squid doesn’t come from a bomb skin care routine but actually refers to the way it literally glows, in the same way that the Enderman’s eyes do." It wont glow like a torch. When I made points on how the Glow Squid is useless for most types of players, you kept going on about how they are useful for this ONE type of player when I explained how it isn't useful to other types of players.I’m settling for the Glow Squid.Sci-fi, on the other hand, is a thinking-squid's genre. yeah but glow squid gets pussy and illagers suck ass, mic drop The resources from the other ones are yellow dye grassless bee farms / uhh ice? so the glow squids are the clear winnernever serenity squid Then you kept saying how the Glow Squid would be great for builders. I agree that they would be useful for builds, but not for other players.Duck down dummy, when I have only ever eaten squid, you licked the wrong thing Zapine !!!!Gigantic weaponized squid boss, anyone?Tbh, minecraft live mob vote is basically rigged, only one mob is the interesting one with the cool ability, if you wanna destroy the norm, vote for either the squid or the cow, who cares, just vote for anything other than the one that has won so many fan votes. Hold up, this all started when I shared my opinion on the Glow Squid being useless, then you responded explaining how the Glow Squid could have the ability to hypnotize people. I gave my opinion on that mechanic and how it probably won't be added.Steal your fellow E-liter mains and delete all their Ninja Squid gear. da ice one seems the most interesting and ads a new mechanic and the squids could make some cool boule with em And the squids seemingly hypnotize you to, so the drowning is basically a mechanic built into this squidGlow squid supremacy Norway has the cods. The UK has mackerel and squid, and you're welcome to it. i want moobloom and glow squid, but chillager should be removed from existence You know what I don’t know what I’ll need the glow squid for, as much as I love the bees I don’t think a cow will help, and I love illagers, so I might vote for ice illager, but I don’t understand why we can’t have all of the above FAIR FAIR IT DOES, BUT MY COW HAS FLOWERS ON ITS BACK AND IS A NICE SHADE OF YELLOW. YOUR SQUID ONLY HAS BRIGHT COLORS ON SMALL SPOTS Bruh I love how all the comment sections on the other posts said glow squid gang and now that this is out everyone’s hating on glow squid I agree especially if they already have them prepared and everything. I mean it isn't like they need to do much coding to change how the squid looks. Didn't know that. Too many teeth... And amphibians aren't really known for having many teeth, now do they. Eh, doesn't matter.... 😅 i will shit and cum if it’s some splatoon rep like one of the squid sisters Squids... Are not blocks... you stupid.... Hey, im about to do the same, did you use squid cache? like endermen's eyes... nothing impressive "The glow in Glow Squid doesn’t come from a bomb skin care routine but actually refers to the way it literally glows, in the same way that the Enderman’s eyes do."Moobloom and glow squid desperately needed strong showcase trailers to even the vote.. with that said.. congrats Iceologer gang🥶  Sadly I've only read one of Lovecraft's books, so I don't know :' Glow squid squad Shit mental homie fuck Dique rehab And to be honest, I always saw the Deep Ones more like deep ocean fish... You know, slimy, weird, disgusting, and with more pointy teeth than any animal would ever really need... Ever Yes, it is basicly a mini boss that i am very exited to figh with. Are you exited to go to the ocean bottom and almost drown to find a useless squid I did review the others, I played Minecraft Earth. I liked the Moobloom but it’s really bland besides maybe for a flower garden. Glow Squid does absolutely nothing. Dude, just look at the people, disrespectful, don't assume that squid is a reskin, try to avoid unavoieable questions, find already responded arguments, while iceologers find excellent arguments and moobloom are just peaceful The icologer doesn't add anything either... He just throws ice at you. The glow squid makes the dark oceans seem a little livelier with light, and the moobloom is just fucking useless.. I would like to believe the glow squid would drop prismarine dust Glow Squid may offer a new kind of light source, dye, and other various blocks used for design. It will also diversify the oceans, making them more fun to explore. "The glow in Glow Squid doesn’t come from a bomb skin care routine but actually refers to the way it literally glows, in the same way that the Enderman’s eyes do." No "entity light source" Glow squid pretty tho HA! Joke's on you, I haven't accepted shit :D it'll take more than a similar color scheme to convince me, and 70% of Vivz characters in HH don't have a nose, so it doesn't count! I think I would look great in it  Theyre speaking the truth. As an american, as well as a female, anf a member of the lgbtq+ community im BEGGING YOU TO NOT VOTE TRUMP Biden isnt the best but hes better than Trump yeah but the squid doesnt and neither does the cow I’m voting Glow Squid, my friend, as it is easily the best option. TOUCHÉ. BUT DID I MENTION THAT MY SQUID GLOWS IN THE DARK. WHAT DOES YOUR COW DO?? MOO??Are you an all-guns-blazing in ya face squid of action? BARBARIAN! Lool you know me well. Cod soup? Lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams, oysters, squid, octopus, and salmon paste?Ja o iceologer não, se a atualização for o das montanhas FARIA TOTAL SENTIDO ele ta na proxima atualização! Uma coisa que a gente quer é um mob que não seja inutil! A glow squid vai ser mais uma lula no game e lula no minecraft n faz quase nada! I’ve said it all along. 1) Iceologer 2) moobloom 3) glow squid the squid is useless though Buddy, the only thing I'm voting for is the glow squid on Minecon LiveMinecraft mob vote time I'm leaning more towards the Moobloom because I really like bees and apparently they're supposed to interact with eachother. The Iceologer would be cool too, and then there's just a squid but glowy and shit.If you vote for the glow squid you lean nothing to me. Really interesting to watch, there was a big grin from me at "a combination of a Squid and a Great White Shark", particularly as Elliot has asked me to crochet a 'Sharktopus' for him for Christmas. Lol hell ya frog, baby squid and a pig! Dorito Squid holds the true power of toggles おはようでございます！ 😂😂 bruhhhh it’s the power of the dorito squidI reserve the shrimp, squid, scallops, and sea eel. sorry, glowing squids may look like it, but they are not an opening for eldritch horrors, hopefully ( i would actually be team squid if that was the case, however it's not for granted ) Yes 👊I don't care what you think "glow squid is just a reskinned squid" fuck you, moobloom is just a reskinned mooshroom and the iceloger is just a reskinned illager. Just like the phantom, we'll want the Iceologer and it'll end up being a hated Minecraft mob. Glow squids are retextured glowing squids. I just want a 4th cow variant.im voting for glow squid おはようございます(´▽`)ノ☕ Retextured glowing squids go brrrrrrrrfuck piss cow, don’t be brad be a chad and vote for glowing squid. YES GLOW SQUID SUPREMACY The only main reason I’m voting for glowy boi is cause there are already so many types of villagers and cows. Squids are just there so having something added to them would be nice AHH OKAY IM VOTING FOR GLOW SQUID CUS I LOVE YOU MORE Or its a squid that glows, how excitin This would be great to win, I know someone who would love it.  Octopus or squid, I am allergic to seafoodanyways omg the minecraft glow squid looks so fucking cool Le Glow squid va servir à rien mais il a l'air stylé alors je le veuxNow that the Debate is over, the floor should consider other options. I think Mr. Thanos and his Infinity Gauntlet Plan sounds promising, as well as Mr. Killmonger's Wakanda Arms Deal, and let's not rule out Mr. Ozymandia's Giant Squid Proposal  Simply because you want glow squid im voting for moobloom 🖕 1- Well know as other mobs 2- Ancient Guardians, Piglins, Blazes, Skeletons, etc. all mobs them have their unique design and caracteristics 3- Same frequence or less than the squids, and no one remember the squids 4- yes but the ocean have a lot of things, upgrade the mountains.. Man I rather have ice squidward to spice up mountains than have flower cow or glow squids , that loose interest after 2 seconds SquidSquid Lee the squirrel jgn x Q: Why are people voting for Glow Squid? A: Maybe Neon Blocks are coming to Minecraft if it gets added To bad I don't want another Illager that's frozen.The Glow Squid is right behind yes. We just need a few more votes. Heil the glow squid The hostile mob isn't memorable either, and the probability of the squid having something else than just being a hositle mob with a new attack is way higher than what you think, so yea, let's just agree to disagree Some people are saying that the Iceologer has purpose and Glow Squid has not. I don't think things are added just because they have purpose, they could be added just because are cool? I mean, not everything in the game have purpose, they just exists to increase the environmentBrenda, I tried snatching a dead squid man's fortune. Don't think I won't snatch your ugly wig, as well. 💪 I'm still gonna vote glow squid to spite someone who insulted me and is now begging for me to vote the ice man my mannn oooo glow squid pretty light Maybe moo moo flower, i dont need rip-off squid kid Thank you zerTo those of you arguing about what mob should be added to Minecraft, please just stop. Arguing isn't gonna help your cause and if you really want the Moobloom, Iceologer, or the Glow Squid, just vote when the time comes. Arguing about it only causes problems among players. And then, the concept between different kind of illager are different. The Glow Squid is a reskin. I mean, it isn't so bad and I think that it shouldn't be in the vote, because it is the less interesting among the other two.Why the hell would you vote for the glowing squid どっちもいけそうだー◎ 😂😂😂 Dude. What kind of weird ass frogs are in your area? BRO IV'E GOT A WHOLE FUCKING NEW BOSS, MOB, AND STRUCTURE IDEA AND YOU GUYS WENT WITH A PISS COW, A GLOWY SQUID, AND A WHITE BOYPiss cow, glow in the dark /im_a_squid_kid, or an angry homeless man that lives on the hills? What are you voting for? Alright, you do you. I'm just warning you that the Glow Squid will be forgotten after a couple of weeks. It seems cool at first, but it gets really boring. Looks really aren't as important as you make them out to be. Glow squid seems like a normal squid boring the iceoager could be op and annoying and the moobloom won’t do anything as wellNow Playing Squid - Clapping Music  By the way they use our dub on s1 for squid girl? I just want a new squid ;-; The new mod that's going to be added, a Glow Squid! The glow Squid is scarely close to the iceologer ta doido vou votar na glow squid que provalvelmente vai trazer uma mecanica inovadora ao game e n vai ser uma desgraca na minha vida WHILE THAT MAY BE TRUE, CAN YOUR SQUID BREATHE THE AIR??? I DO NOT BELIEVE SOso whos voting for glow squid? It's not another illager it has cool properties unlike glow squid. Yellow cow would be my pick if it could have flowers be placed where ever it goes or something. Interesting video. I think I know what the Glow Squid could be useful for. A vibe carried by all of our friends ❤️Im a squid now Fair, glow squid looks cooler imo. Can we agree iceologer sucks? Faz um desenho da glow squid pfvAs a map maker, I'd vote for the iceologer. But as a survival player I'd prefer the moobloom. But as a builder I'd love to see the glow squid. This is going to be hard...Cultural foods in Toronto are unique but not rare. Food from Spanish, Cuttlefish rice is one of the most famous dishes in Spanish cuisine. It is made with squid (or squid) and rice (Mood: 😐) Why the fuck would u want a glow squid Looks like when he was a kid.does anyone else think that the mobs mojang is introducing to vote for this years minecraft live are soooo boring like who gives a fuck about some glowing squid or a yellow cow? Is the glow squid just a retextured squid, or does it actually have a sort of "thrall" or "hypnosis" affect like in the video? I'm worried that the vote is essentially between to recolored mobs and one genuinely interesting one (the iceologer).Glow Squid idea: If the glow squid is struck by lighting(somehow) it should turn into like a Kraken boss to drop some unique loot. So far the archetypes of people that vote on each mob (that aren't brain dead that is) Chillager: Players that enjoy challenge, lore and magic Moobloom: Players that like farming, cuteness and flowers Glowing Squid: Players that like building, ambience and aesthetics We're all there hun, yes. Still, I am sorry you are feeling this, epically job wise. Everything sucks atm. Like 1 blow brings down my whole day and zaps my energy bc we're all raw. My depression has been terrible too, so I feel you. Take care of yourself hun. i want moobloom but philza minecraft wants the squid 👁👄👁 and i cant go against philza minecraft I’m doing everything i can to prevent people from voting for another hostile mob. I’m fine if I don’t get my squid as long as we don’t have another phantom I wish we could vote for iceologer or glow squid and moobloom since they are smaller mobs Glow squid ftw I'm going to go with Moobloom. It's not an interesting mob but I don't like the premise of the Iceologer, nor am I willing to vote for a hostile mob after what happened last time, and it looks like the Glow Squid paralyses you which sounds incredibly annoying. Welcome back 🤜🤛 The tough times make you stronger boss! You always keep it real which is why you get the love from the community BUT THE SQUID Un gran amigo y bastante piola 👍,vas a votar al glow Squid pero en mi planeta me enseñaron a respetar incluso a los terraplanistas así que todo piolaphilza want glow squid glow squid is my vote for endtlantis ExactlySo im Stuck between The Glow Squid and the Icologer (or Chillager) Potentially You can drown underwater while being allured by the glow squid early in game, but the Icologer has a unique attack... We need magic Items toooo Are you team glow squid or team moobloom Fantastic giveaway xx A glowing squid that drops ink sacks. Emeralds are actually useful, ink sacks are for dye, that’s it. Iceloger and Glowing squid also supports trans rights, and since they're better than stupid yellow cow they should be voted, specially cool squid i really wish we got the squid thing it looks really cool and the ocean needs more enemies Absolutely there with you babe. It's so discouraging when you feel like nothing is working even though you did everything right. Just take care of you and your headspace as best as you can 3 Thanks :) No god, it's horrible, vote Squid exactly! squids were always underrated, it's their time to shine! or to glow! but there’s already so many cows and villagers i think the squid needs a friend :. don’t want it to be all lonelyglow squid supremacy It's shit Aw cute w IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE PISS IT IS A PRETTY FLOWER COW. ALSO ITS NOT LIKE GLOW SQUIDS WILL BE BETTER THAN NORMAL SQUIDS, THEYLL BE JUST AS ANNOYINGEat less beef? Sure - but don't forget that the seas are being vacuumed clear of fish too. Some areas now fit only for squid+jellyfish  Guys a squid. He doesn’t like himself Mountains are so boring. Add a mountain hostile mob. Squids that glow? Dope, will be forgotten within a month. Same with the cow dude the moobloom looks like piss also i hate squids with a burning passion i want pretty squids Hey squid, you wanna know something? Your a king. Took a situation and instead of giving up, you picked yourself back up and did your best. I can’t wait for you to be completely back on your feet, and I’m cheering you on.this even happens in dreams that start as nightmares too like ftr I am deathly afraid of octopi and squid so those old pirate movies scare the ever loving shit out of me well I had a dream like that once, and I got pulled close to that big spooky eye, and for some reason “...” She loves the little squid Iceologer is a retextured pillager Glow Squid is a retextured squid Hush, they're technically all reskins Their "wow" upon seeing the Glow Squid sounds so unenthusiastic. It's almost as if the dev team already knows that Glow Squids suck. I SEE YOUR POINT BUT I AM GOING TO HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. GLOW SQUID IS LIKE NOMRAL SQUID BIT IT GLOWS Yeah but like what would the glow squid bring to the tableI plan to add some dust/dirt around Tycho’s body there later on, to depict the squid slamming his body down on the ground at his back, for some extra detailI plan to add some dust/dirt around Tycho’s body there later on, to depict the squid slamming his body down on the ground at his back, for some extra detail Glow squid, cause i for one think its gonna have a good hidden featureI usually don’t get into politics but after that debate... I can’t decide on whether to vote for the Glow Squid or Icologer We got like 3 different colored cows and hella lot of villagers and pillagers I just want pretty squid 😭 DUDE GLOW SQUID LOOKS LIT AND WE HAVE ENOUGH PILLAGERS NOT TO MENTION THE MECHANICS FOR DUNGEONS ARE NOT THE SAME AS IN VANILLA MCi’m voting glow squid idc what yall say same although the squid is pretty i like piss cow betteralso I think they're biased for the iceologer bc they actually told us a bit about what it'll do in the game unlike the glow squid and moobloom. I vote for the glow squid.Squid Squad - Splattack! (Jam Session) (Menyam Localisation) "I must say i have never seen a squid girl before. Its not everyday you encounter one either~" Squid Doesn’t emit lightHT: Diviteers 14 Jackals 8. This one could go either way. Both sides with two injured players. Diviteers losing their king, Griffin Young to a ghostly squid attack. A late TAndre Lord (TUA) touchdown cuts the lead to just 6. It may not be the weirdest game, but no one is leaving Dude nobody else explore the abysse's to just find a squid with a different texture Zombies is idk i want some piss cow but also that weed squid Fun sponge 🙄 I want glow squid 🥺 Stay tuned. ;) Yeah thats him he is deadly ha but unfortunately squid git his account shut as far as i can see.. I’d agree. Just got through asking my friend why squid does so much, put 40% or more from a single combo. In two combos I put someone at like 120% I said I was doing ganon damage lol The squid is the cutie see that right there is undeniably racist although i do believe it’s extremely hard to be actually racist to a white person for their skin color that in fact was one of those times I'm voting squid cos it looks pretty Who even plays Minecraft for the challenge, iceologer just sounds like vindicator but ice Moobloom is okay ig I don't like all three of these mobs but I want a distraction squid El squid toda vía no tenemos información puede que sea más interesante que los demás, tiene más potencial de serlo. O puede que no haga nada xDTeam Glow Squid for the win.Don't ever look The Furry Squid Falcon in the eye. My husband's girl ran into one out by the bush and never came home. Yeah gloe squid looks interesting now when they released the video Nice drawing but I don’t want the next phantom so I have to go with glow squidglow squid supremacy Don’t worry I’m voting for glow squid pisscow is cute but glow squid... 🥺 I'm going to vote for it and never regret it. I voted phantom and never regretted it. I sure as hell won't regret voting for it over a squid that I'm in no way excited about. First, the moobloom is good for farms. Second, the glow squid is amazing for builders like us. The iceologer will be great ONLY for the survivalists. You guys don’t seem to see how it will affect the other types of players at all. Just yourselves. It’s pretty sad tbh.Glow Squid looks best just sayin... YEP Sounds delicious would enjoy cooking with this Let's be real, no one cares about squids except for ink sacs or the occasional aquarium project which most people tend to use sea lanterns, sea pickles, or now lanterns for underwater lighting. Be smart and vote for the Iceologer, not something that has so little to offer. 😁 That sucks my guy, but yeah 100 gecs is awful. Squid sisters forever! small man,,, moobloom and glow squid are pretti 3 hehe glow squid go whoooo “Little squid...” I can’t believe it till i see it. I don’t want to end up heartbroken if I don’t end up seeing him but I’ll take your half your word on it lol The squid could drop some sort of material that allows for really bright torches, and possibly coloured lights. Glow Squids only "glow" like the eyes of a spider or enderman. It is not a mobile light source and does not use dynamic light. It's been in Minecraft Earth since February, we already know how they play. Also, it is confirmed and known to be purely passive/peaceful. 1✔ 2✔ 3 Volounteer builder for Amioun home if squid is on the menu Zombies sucks Oooooh yes please! Lovely common Jules! Pulling them in as you do! By the time your finished with that lake it will have scopex squid silt!😂🎣😘 you are kinda wrong there buddy, no guarantee to new drops, but if you pay attention to the squid update you might notice the devs get "enchanted" by the squid, which seems to be the only interesting thing so far about them, however it is to note that the devs might've just joked But... a squidglow squid The Iceologer is much more tolerable and is the clear winner. The Iceologer offers more for the game than the Moobloom and the Glow Squid combined. Gameplay interest will always beat out cosmetics!I’m ether voting Iceologer or Glow squid The glow squid could have some unique attacks with the devs being hypnotized in the video, it could hypnotize you underwater to try to make you drown, though, that’s not proved, just speculation, I hope more gets revealed at mineconyeah she want a squid tonight 🦑🦑🦑Please don’t be stupid and vote for the glow squid. The iceoliger sits at the top of the new steep mountains to hit you off basically limiting you from exploration, and the moobloom will just be another useless cow. But the glow squid is a actual bright mob light sourceYou want me to show my dick? Fuck it. *Puts on squid hat* There's my dick. You can do it! We believe in you! I'm definitely voting Glow Squid, but the moobloom isn't a shabby option either. Though anybody who votes for ice pillager is wrong. The players that voted moobloom want something more peaceful. The majority of those votes would likely go to the squid. Splitting that evenly is not an accurate representation of what would happen. Glow Squid is a terrible choice. Do you prefer cosmetic-based mobs which won't be very interesting for the game, far less than the fox, or a mob that adds new mechanics into that could be utilized for map makers, minigames, etc? This tweet is the "space squid" of NY hockey. Islander and Ranger fans must unite to destroy it. What's the point? they will simply change the texture of the squid and add a glow like the eyes of an enderman. It won't even glow like a torch.. That goes for literally any mob when you have netherite lol. Also you can say the same for the cow and squid yknow 🤷 Why are you comparing a passive squid mob to a hellspawn called Phantom? And who said we are getting a new ice block? It will probably be an entity (just like llama spit). AND, Chillagers will be a disaster for you if you decide to live on the mountains, smh Well the glow squid has an effect when you go near it which dosent allow you to swim, so if you run out of breath your basically stuck underwater which makes exploring the oceans annoying. So the glow squid is the phantom instead. It doesn’t have to do anything. Minecraft is not just about survival. There are many ways to play Minecraft, oh, but you are too ignorant to realize that. You can’t seem to see the possibilities of the squid. The useless mobs in the game are some of my favorites. You really don't know about how these work do you? Okay, let's say we get rid of moobloom and share its votes equally between iceologer and glow squid. Iceologer would still win by a large amount... GLOW SQUID IS COOL TOO I WILL ADMIT BUT PISS COW THO At least the glow squid is something unique other than another villager like we didn’t already have 50 of em im disappointed in jardoonAbsolutely loving squid for flooding my tl with poe bsd might retweet all of their poe tweets as much as i love piss i also like glowy squid “...” Hold. Little red squid you reminded me I should really put my phone down for a while so I can finish my late work I have a lot of work to doSquid Sisters - Bomb Rush Blush (Waorani Localisation) Yes it is lame. Vote Glow Squid if you don't want to have a snowball fight everytime you go up the new bueatiful mountains coming soon. Ukraine, Russia, China, UAE, Israel, Saudi Arabia - does it really matter where the bribe comes from? If a candidate is accepting favors or money from foreign actors in exchange for special deals, they should be disqualified. No Squid Pro Quo! 🦑 Wow 🤩 NAAAAAAAAAAA GLOW SQUID GLOW SQUID better not vote for the squid I swear to god if you do! What if you take the moobloom out of the question? It’s clear that the moobloom lost, so what about Glow Squid Vs Chillager? It would be very very close to a tie.mano agr com o video da glow squid do mob vote eu quero votar nela Glow squid 🦑 👁 You can just hide a repeating command block saying [kill [type=Chillager] Or Mojang could just add a game rule to disable chillagers/glow squids, if the glow squid wins, this setting will exist 100% because it’s a passive-aggressive mob, like the phantomsPour les glow Squid, nous pourrions avoir un nouveau moyen d'éclairage et cela egayerait les océans la nuit. 😊 ong pas besoin d'influer mon vote puisqu'il va aller au golf Squid.

Le nouvel illager arrive un peu tôt sachant que ceux-ci sont arrivés il y a 2 mis à jour this is all ritz's fault piss cow and glow squid are dating. icologer is homophobic not too much but it would be better than a fucking squid Moobloom fucking squid Racism exists outside of the banner of oppression, the pure definition of racism agrees with this. You judge a person based off of their race without them being oppressed, it is still being racist. Discrimination against a white man solely off of their race would still be racism. SQUID BC WEVE HAD THE SAME SQUID FOR SO LONG AND ITS UGLY لففففيوووو 💘 everyone was pissed when shadows bo3 trailer dropped cause there were squids and now look at that map. chill and have faith in treyarch. don’t wanna start with an ar-15? then fucking don’t you can change that. don’t like the cans? stupid thing to not like it’s CANS. because they are glow squid gang Yw :3 Octupi (or squid) tentacles match the lace gloves--who'd have thought that except you?

Iceologer is the bestGoodbye fire-squid, hello silver fox!A demon-squid in a round hidden object game with farts. I appreciate the moobloom a lot! I'm torn between that and the glow squid! -- I think the only reason people are voting Iceologer more is because we know more about them than any other mob. There's so much more value in just picking the chillager the glow squid would be cool if it spawned underground but they spawn in deep oceans حطي ببالك انك تملكين حياة الكثير يتمنوها وبتعذبوو بسببها وانتي وصلتي لها انظري لايجابيات حياتك وحريتك تقدرين تغيرين نمط معيشتك بسهولة واختيار شريك حياتك بسهولة تقدرين تتخذين اسهل او اصعب القرارات بملكك انتي 💞 متاكدة انك قوية وبتقدرين تتخطين مشاكل الماضي 💘 Would be nice if this provides GLOW SAC so we can make actual glow blocks.

I don't think so I think it would be cool for the squid to have a hypnosis effect like in the video. Maybe it can drop something new that you can use to make a hypnosis potion or a "neon dye" that could be used to make leather armor that glows. (the ideas are not mine) Squid next is shrimps in Minecraft Je vote glow squid si tu vote glow squid monsieur. Pierre hmm, i think this is the most rational team squid statement, kudos to ya, since it's actually a good point? Погоди.... Иерофант? Кто-то значит всё-таки делает таро по хк!1. I love pretty environmental Mobs, regardless of use. 2. We don’t currently have any other Squid variants, but we have many Cow Illager variants. 3. Squids are available in all difficulties whereas the Iceologer cannot be found in Peaceful. Piss cow or glow squid yall Now I need squid doggo Going by you logic Moobloom: just another cow, not like we have enough or anything Squid: just a squid that glows like an endermen mas eu imagino q eles possam adicionar algum corante brilhante que consegue com a glow squid. imagina fazer armadura de couro brilhante ou lâmpada de cimento brilhante Actually i think they don't want it because it's the one with most effort to put out, if you read the squid tweet you can see "an procrastinator's dream" which can be interpreted as glowing squid being a lazy mob to implementI'll vote for the glow squid if the submarine comes with it. syd the squid 💯💫 I want squid :( It’s ok Love glow squid : I knew they were more than just squids lol Ok So you could put Swim tracksuits Submarines Things tho breathe with air underwater But you put a squid? Omg Well I do find it kind of suspicious that every time you bring up my sex life you always inject yourself into it, as if you want a big tall strong muscular hairy well groomed bear such as myself plowing into you like a wheat field. I think you just need to get laid squid. But, but... Glowsquid can glow and can squid! I don't need more than this BUT THE SQUID IT COOL I CANT DECIDE Eating more squid 🦑 It’s the future!johnny joestar defense squid  Typical kid who's voting on the glow squid because it looks cool. IKR?!?!! People are only thinking "oooo shiny!" and are hoping that the creature will actually emit lighting instead of having a glowing texture like endermen eyes. Bruh if glow squid wins imma be pissed I WAS LIKE S. SQUID???Bruh peeps voting for the iceologer just because is quote more useful. The only thing useful about it is that it just throws ice at you and it will fit the new update. When the glow squid can make the ocean a new mob and prob has hypnosis powers. What mob does that  actually, it's a high possibility that it's just a comical effect for the video, since the iceologer had freezing and the moobloom gave agnes heart eyes. The blog post also says that the squid is purely aesthetical and doesn't interract nor attack anything. Your making assumptions idiot the iceologer adds challenge and life to the mountains and glow squids probably dont even drop glowing inc sacs and when people see it in the ocean they will go hm thats neat and then leave it adds nothing to the game. There's just as much cow types as illager types (also, illagers aren't villagers just because they look similar; that doesn't meam they can't do something interesting) squids are kinda left alone buuut.... Glow squid do what enderman doDo not vote Iceologer. Vote for Glow Squid, please. If not Glow Squid, vote Moobloom. The Iceologer is incredibly lame. Glow squid If the glow squid dropped slime and allowed for another cool farm..... just maybe We actually don't know if any of them have unique drops but I bet Mooblooms don't. So vote Glow Squid or Iceologer for more content. Going by your logic: Just a passive cow that barely drops anything new. Just a squid retexture and uninteresting possible neutral mob (no, they are not a light source, they've addressed that it'd only glow like endermens' eyes). Glow squid pweaseIf you don't vote for the glowing squid during minecraft live, you're not my friend anymore.  Maybe you can ask the question, is the glow squid going to introduce dynamic lighting or just a vibrant texture? they said literally nothing about that squid just glows like enderman eyes... Enderman eye light so stop vote glow squid glow squid best option Glow squid *hugs* The point is why vote for a useless illager that adds no fun to the game? Probably gonna drop ice and/or snowballs. Glow squid could drop glowing ink sacks or something I would vote for the glowing squid because it would be a better mob than the drowned. I am so terrified of the drowned that I’ll never update my Minecraft: Java Edition game and Ill never go in the water in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. I won £5 last week.. can't see the Quidco game algorithm allowing me to win anymore :( Stuck on 11 squids since the weekendIn this timeline, Justin Hammer recovers the the time stone by winning an online auction. However, Wong becomes the Silver Surfer. The Infinity Gauntlet is wielded by Thor. In the end, Thanos teleports an alien squid into Times Square, killing millions. Glow Squid is the best option, as the other two are somewhat lame (especially the hundredth illager variant). I support trans rights but i'm still voting for the glow squid Have to agree, as much as I was Pro glow squid before based on its design, it sounds to me like this is the worst option. The last time we voted for a cryptic mob was the phantom, and we all know how that turned out. All in all, I’m gonna safely say I’m from now onhello friends, if you vote for a flower cow, then if she doesn’t make it to the final who will your vote sing for: a glowing squid or an iceologer? охуенные эскизы татух but... they made the bat AND the regular squid and pandas and parrots and other stuff that does absolutely nothingIf you don’t vote for the goddam glow squid I will crack your spine to shine as brightly as the glow sticks they resemble Im not a Squid fan, but i didnt like the Iceologer Glow squid is cooler If it’s still said in a derogatory way... you’re wrong.So they didnt really explain much about the squid either. The iceologer will still be my vote. NOOO GLOW SQUID A SUFUCAR ;__; No ur lying to urself Even if the iceloger is a boring dumbass they’ll be more interesting than the stagnant aesthetic pieces that are the cow and squid I prefer squids over mooblooms because they might just look off. Maybe if they're a really rare mob that only spawns in flower biomes it would be better. I like the squid since if they were to make underwater ravines dark, they could be really interesting mobs. If for some reason the glow squid wins I hope they don't make it as dumb as the normal squid. I don't want to vote a mob that suffocates itself Jardon, u know that raids are hard enough with the current illagers why do you want another illager in minecraft to make your life even more miserable, glow squids ftw Tell me what the squid does And it’s only a pair of sick squids! No chance they'd do that its gonna be a normal squid that glows and nothing else in dissapointed by the options this poll, I'm going iceologer i cant believe people are voting glow squid.... If the shiny squid wins, will the texture of the water and the baho del mar in Minecraft Bedrock change? why both platforms have many differences in the oceans and I would like them to be the same on both platforms :)Moobloom - textured cow Glowsquid - textured squid Chillager - slightly original. VOTE CHILLAGER So basically a radiated squid with hypnotizing ability? Damn. You have nothing to apologize for, hope things calm down on your end soon 😊 glowing squid just a reskinned cow The squid and cow are equal We need more information!! Like does the glow squid actually hypnotize u? That could be really cool! We just don’t know anything about the mobs tbh... moobloom and squid is a snoozefest The Glow squid will brings something new to the table something that adds on to a mob that has been neglected for years and hardly anyone cares about. This is a change that need to happen even to the parts of minecraft that kinda seem boring and don't matter to make the game.... We understand it’s ok, take the time you need. Glow squid all the way Not your fault, Gin. It's ok to have some off time, we're all still here.Vote glow squid or Steve from Minecraft will break into your house and eat your toilet roll Eu vou votar na Moobloom, eu até mudei a Hashtag e eu até queria a Glow Squid, mas tem que votar apenas em uma, então eu votei nela Villagers have gotten there shine it time for a mob that has not changed hardly at all from when it was released to now. The squid has gotten no up draw to it and the design as never changed and it has not variety like the villagers have gotten in the past couple of updates... Oh yea clothing all the fresh squid and octo kids loves their fashion Also the glow squid literally does nothing. It’s a squid that looks cool. It could have a chance to have a special dye or something but besides that 😡 bad this post was made by glow squid gangi’m gonna keep tweeting about glow squid until the vote comesNot to get into politics but... glow squid seems like a pain, IceologerGang Everyone vote glow squid dream said so so it must be true Still, better option than a fucking cow or squid Glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow squid glow Happily 😃 loved ♥️ liked ✅ and shared 👥 Ok glow squid voter I would much rather have a glow squid be president than any of these two geezers When I saw glow squid I thought it would just be a squid that does the exact same thing and just happens to glow, same with the moobloom, but the iceologer looks more original I guess squid I thought for a split sec this meant dm like datemate and i was horribly confused No I used surveys that can be easily looked up. The overwhelming majority of whites are not offended by cracker because it means nothing to them. Insults are not “equal” by the way. There’s no level ground where poopoohead is the same as sp*c or the n-word. Don’t be naive. 아!!!!! 그거그리려캔버스켯엇어요 맞다맞다 감삼다if it’s glow squid tho i will 1000% make up some sort of craft and make a HUGE glowing squid for my room The iceologer has more potential to be annoying than a squid that glows I like glow squids since having some deep sea mob would be cool. Squid and moobloom suck the squid will do nothing!!11 Pacifica is going to hug the squid girl tightly. Not everyday you encounter a squid girl after all If the copy of the squid was useful then why not, but there it is a complete eeskin head full just moobloom n glow squid i cant decide Phantoms drop something unique too and no one cares about them, it's not a valid argument. They need to drop something useful and the best candidate for this is the squid. (The cow comes second, because harvesting flowers might be good too!) Probably 😂 except the squid 🤢 I want to have the glow squid because it’s 100% pointless Puppy love took a lot of explaining and then E was very focused on your lights. He thinks they look like squids.I'm only voting glow squid for minecraft if mojang confirms it drops an item that can make glowing wool Huh? I think they will drop some glowing ink that can be used to be glowing blocks which in turn makes cool builds. Mojang and Microsoft aren’t that dumb to make a useless mob like a glowing squid if they want the game to last 90 more yearssquid hate me so bad, i didn’t even do anything to that elderly man 烏賊さんおやすみなさい🐑💤Like, unless you can tame the glow squid I don’t see much of a point in this, the last mob update gave us the Phantom which can be used to repair the elytra. Does anybody see any purpose in these new mobs?Alright everyone so genuine question here, Minecraft’s new mob vote doesn’t seem like it has any sort of purpose, does it? The Moobloom is just a Mooshroom with flowers instead of mushrooms, the Iceoliger is just an absolute annoyance, and the glow squid is just, a light up squid Yes it is ☹️ Glow Squid is best and if you think otherwise, you are a dog, not a cat. We don't need more hostile mobs. We want cool passive mobs. There's barely any mobs in the ocean. Also I want another squid!!! I didn't even know what was the point of the assignment either 🤮😭 In college I had to dissect owl poop but we were actually trying to find something but the squid? Wtf The moobloom is hella cute BUT we already have cows, and illagers but we only have ONE SQUID Moobloom. It’d offer bees more of a purpose supposedly and give a cool new cow variant. The glowing squid looks, but doesn’t seem to have too much of a purpose, and Iceologers just seem annoying. Remember the Phantom? Glow squid is the best one.Seems like people are going to vote for the glow squid over the iceoleger 🤢 team squid thinks it does, how negligent half of them probably are just trolling But they they're cute and they 🌟 g l o w 🌟 Yeah I know they're pretty much useless based on the info we're given about them but we already have the mooshroom and we have a wide variety of hostile mobs. I just think having another kind of squid would be nice 😅♥️ HELPFLE i cant decide between the moobloom or the glow squid but prob the glow squid theyre so COOL LOOKING i love it Idk, it's my opinion, but I think squid is the best, I'm gonna vote for him!!!) I'd like the moobloom to be added. I usually like being a beekeeper and the moobloom are beefriends. Also, the glowing squid seems entirely useless and the icologer seems cool but would is rare enough for me not to be intrested in it. Squid Squad unite ! sigh. *pulls out sketchbook* Calling someone ugly is generally more offensive to people than calling them a cracker. It holds little to no weight historically unless you really REALLY want to play the victim. Punching up is obviously not the same as punching down. Next you’ll say gringo is offensive. Oh yeah we did squids too and our fucking teacher then fried them up and served them to us oh my god I forgot about that until now 😰ガンガゼ野外音楽堂 初期8ステージのひとつ。かの有名な「Squid Squad」をはじめ、様々なアーティストがライブを行う、ロックの聖地と言われているステージ。 Still, things like that don't change the fact that the Glow Squid does nothing. The hypnosis bit was a joke, because IRL bioluminescence is pretty and mesmerizing. The Glow Squid is not going to hypnotize people. I doubt that, they describe it as being very similar to the squid except it “glows”. Its just a reskin, or a reskin with an annoying ability.If I vote, it will be for either glow squid, because maybe they'll add glowsticks or have them drop sea pickles, which would be nice. Or the MooBloom, since mobile bee pollen gather locations would be cool. Also like if you could get honey bottles from them that would be amazing. really said squid x squid but on different accounts huh 😍 Glow squid  Ima be pissed if Moobloom doesn’t win, atleast have glow squids win. I DONT WANT ANOTHER HOSTILE MOB SMH- Extending on the last point, maybe people can make puzzles and dungeons that use the light of the blocks to tell the player where to move, if the glowy inc sacs are a thing and can be dispensed - More diverse ocean life :D - Fanart potential - Xisuma glow squid skin maybe Although he cannot use the kraken (but maybe squid dog can use?) 3rd, squids drop less ink sacsglow squids are so COOL !! and mooblooms are so CUTE AAAAA I CANT DECIDE Again, the same could be said for the Glow Squid. If it wins, people will be disappointed since it really doesn't do anything. People will probably forget it exists after a few weeks after having it in the game. nee, glow squid is de beste the squid would be cool with shaders but meh Trump shut up Biden high Unfortunately the Glow Squid won’t do any of that. It’s not a mobile light source and doesn’t use dynamic light. If they dropped something used in the creation of colored light sources, I’d vote for it but I very very highly doubt the glow squid would do anything that impactful. Your anger fuels me. Now my vote is set in stone. Glow squid it is.Moida Hobo Jay here to support the squid uprising! Go !! The glow squid should hypnotize the player when starring into it, like it did in the videoSquid gang gang gang 😤😤😎😎 Vote squid gang for Minecraft so we can have epic squid sacks 😎😎😎 Superb this would be amazing They should had told us upfront Moobloom-Flower farms, dyes, bees, bee farms, a possible new food/item when you kill the cow and maybe a new milk or some other liquid it gives. Glow squid-wowo me pretty now let me go on the shore and just stay there and die because I'm just a simple squid but glowy. :) the chilliger brings the new mechanic of being able to literally summon blocks, will be the 4th snow unique mob, and it adds a new reason to go to the snow mountains. the moobloom is a reskin of the mooshroom, doesn’t do anything else. glow squid will be phantom 2.0, it drowns u the chillager would be boring/annoying to fight while the glow squid would offer another sense of beauty to minecraft's oceanboth glow squid and moobloom are awesome, just really hope that dumbass chillager doesnt win イカさん中性的で良いですね！確かにフリーメイソンだ！笑 I'm with the in between gang in saying both burn the witch and glowier squid Glow squid I hope glow squid gives off light and doesn’t just look like it glows I found at TkMaxx. Also beware of salt that appears black––some are seasoned with squid ink or smoked in some way to make it look black. From what I understand this is a specific sulfuric kind that is different from those. yeaaa, they're super vaguee so idk either :// but,, COOL SQUID HNGGEl glow squid hipnotiza o es todo una broma? find flowers and leather and sugarcane and squids and feathers and wood to leave everyone a chest with a flower and book that saus a nice message :) ハゲ40本 Only interesting mob choice here, giving it's the one mojang is going to have the hardest job doing, prove me wrong Cow Squid fans. Also, stop acting like another hostile mob is a problem, besides we are getting a mountain update, it's only fitting.Do y'all want a cool glowy squid? Potentially luminescent dye?? Or do y'all want a piss cow that only acts as an attraction to bees and ANOTHER illager that will only be annoying to deal with like other illagers? The thing that is interesting, though, is that it will maybe lure mobs towards it. In fact, I really hope that the lure hypnotic mechanic was not only a sketch and it could actually be useful. It could just make the Glowing Squid a "turtle egg" mob, hopefully for all mobsbtw vote for GLOW SQUID we need more variety in the ocean and tbh the chillager would not be fun to have in the game I don't really see the point of a glow squid. How is it different than a regular squid other than it glowing? Does it have a special drop or special abilities? コンテンツにされかけている！？にげる！！ bruh the glow squid is the lamest option you will probably the worse option you will see it at most when you occasionally mine into an ocean cave Zach Snyder opening telegrams that just read "I heard you took the fucking squid out? Say it ain't so." i like it as well :3 i won't be sad if the glow squid wins !! Glow Squid :) yeah it does look cool af, but you can download a texture pack that changes the squids to the glow squid. But glow squids aren’t evil, they said they’re entirely passive And they don’t get to act as a moving light source. So much potential and glow squid just doesn’t end up doing anything I'm one of the few who would vote for the glowsquid even though I know there's no chance it's gonna win. 😅 I just think our ol' squid deserves a 'glow up' ♥️👌 Guys guys settle down let’s all agree that ice ILLAGER and glowing squid are both cool but no one talk about piss cow Squid gang bad. Ice Gang good. it may have no function but my brain sees Sick Ass Squid and goes ooaoaaa The f*cking squid don’t glow, and the iceologer is a new mob and is cool 😎 (´･ω･`) flower cow flower cow.... it’s so adorable i might have to go for it but at the same time . SICK SQUID イカちゃんは右担当で、私は左担当になります。 ともにとうやたんのスイカの育成を頑張ろう！。 おー！。 Builders are way bigger than you think. The Minecraft subreddit is packed with cool creations of people’s cities, maps, houses, etc. What you said is ignorant. In many of the polls, it’s a close 50/50 with the chillager and Glow Squid. maar fuck glow squid OMG GLOW SQUID SMASH!!tired of hostile villagers 🥱 GIMME SOME FLOWER COW AND LIGHT SQUID ‼️‼️I swear if y'all vote for the god damn squid then u would have created phantom 2.0. we don't need that! glow squid is just a squid, but the texture has glowy streaks on it. Thats it. Literally the squid but has stripes イカさんちは電流流れた有刺鉄線My reasons for voting Glow Squid: 1. I love pretty environmental Mobs, regardless of use. 2. We don’t currently have any other Squid variants, but we have many Cow Illager variants. 3. Squids are available in all difficulties whereas the Iceologer cannot be found in Peaceful. EとかFはないよ？ not sure of the functions of the glow squid but piss cow gives flowers so rn, im voting for them WE HAVE TOO MANY ILLIGARS ALREADY WHAT IS THE POINT?? THEY'RE JUST GONNA BE ANNOYING TO DEAL WITH AND AS USELESS AS MOST OTHER ILLIGARS! GLOW SQUIDS COULD ALSO BE VERY USEFUL FOR DYE AND OTHER RESOURCES. Glow squid hangs living in your head rent free Based on the trailer it seems like it could indirectly be a hostile mob, hinted at by the fact that all the speakers got distracted by it, but if used well it could possibly be the hands down coolest way to set up lighting in your base. Will it be a challenge? Yes but squidtorch What? No "President Squid"? Sydney(Squid) Mills is one of our family’s treasures!! She is the full package! We have enough illagers Squid is alone Now kissLemme educate yall about minecraft Iceologers are an original enemy in minecraft dungeons, a game centered around combat and fighting hoards of mobs. You really want a mob like that in the new mountains??? Moobloom or glow squid please!!!! わが犬は自分のおならに毎回びっくりする。 頭はいいが抜けている。GLOW SQUIDi’m stuck between piss cow and cool squid, but i do NOT want another annoying hostile villager mf No more squids! drug squid or piss cow ........... decisions decisions Well he’s the most unique honestly. Glow Squid looks cool but is useless (looks cool though) and the Moobloom is kinda just there. But like, that's an actually unique trait. The other two are literally just retextured mooshrooms and squids i would take that mimic squid from the vote that added the phantoms over anything else any day Squids Ooh, ten thousand percent squid sisters. Of the hook is good but it just doesn't stand a chance to me GLOW SQUIDS CAN HYPNOTIZE YOU AND ARE PRETTY ICEILLAGERBOY IS JUST A STUPID BOY WHO LIKES SNOW TOO MUCH PISS COWWe should be nice to Glow Squids, because if we vote for them, maybe they would return the favor and hypnotize Mojang into adding the Cave Update.  目！笑 I personally like the moobloom, but I’ll vote for the glow squid if it means the iceologer isn’t added That would actually be cool, but unfortunately I think that might have just been a gag and it's literally just a squid that emmits light Better than u apparently ドヤカットインB.Bすこですw イカさん不在だったんですか？もったいないー Glowy squid yellow cowPersonally, I'm voting for the Glow Squid. What about you?GLOW SQUID I was going to vote glow squid, but it was just so underwhelming. All it is is a squid that emits light, no mention of anything else. At least the chillager has a very unique attackSquid just left me 🥺🥺 I don't care what my friends look like. (Unless it is something detrimental to their health) Kindness and humor counts. Vote the squid. The sky army will see you in court xD THE GLOWING SQUIDS OR SOMETHING R PRETTY BUT THIS JUST GIVES ME GOOD VIBES💔💔💔 I want either the moobloom or the iceologer, both are fine, i don't understand the hype for the glowing squid honestly とてもかわいい！！ Aaaa no it’s to dangerous, I’ll go back to team glow squid やった！！ありがとうございます！ daar hebben ze mensen als jij voor ,die zelf al aangeven dat ze het ,zelf niet snappen. Glow squid is enderman confirmed? Garlic and herb salmon from Waitrose fish counter, will fry some squid (sans batter) and prawns in lemon and herb. Got some weird salad stuff from Waitrose - which looks suspiciously Lib Dem - to have with it. Why the glow squid?Which Mob Will You Be voting at I would go for Iceologer and glow squid but I gotta choose one tho 😬 anyways who your voting for? Hes the most powerful person on the planet, so go to schoolphilza minecraft in love with glow squidPHILZA SUPPORTS GLOW SQUID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Vote Glow Squid for Minecraft! They didn't mention that it drops Prismarine Crystals in Minecraft Earth! No more having to go after guardians for sea lanterns! Ok so the moobloom looks really cute and add more to flower biomes, but they don’t add much to gameplay. The new Pillager might add more to gameplay and might drop a new item, problem is it could be the new phantom. The glow squid might drop something cool but we can’t be sure First impression: SQUID GIRL Your nickname in my head: TURTLELURTLE Closeness ratings [1-10]: 7 must talk moresss You are my: cute chatting beaner Would I fight you behind McDagonalds: how about wendys? Should you post this too: yupps true but the squids just gonna glow, the cows at least gonna do something they said Although I think Wallace is the only out at Fox with any respectably. So he is more far than the rest. I would but she’s giving me a squid for every tweet Bruh i just call it pisscow in general im not ganna stop calling it pisscow, and no im voting squid 조와요i don't wanna get political but im voting for the glow squid plot twist we all decide the squid is the best one and vote it 100 percent I was watching someone live and a statement was made that it was just Internet blood sports. I mean the mod was for the most part on Trump’s side and he still fucked up.I feel like they'll glow like enderman's eyes. I'm not well knowledged in the technical side of minecraft, but is having it actually give off real light even possible? All the arguments I've seen for glow squid are "it looks cool". Okay? What else? Is that it? no we're adding an entire minigame revolving around this glow squid 元々犬そりレース用に交配された犬種らしいからパワーはあるね。 SQUID GANG, GANG SHIT, SKRRTTT, PAPAPAPAPA BANG BOOM LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOO SQUID GANG, GANG SHIT, SKRRTTT, PAPAPAPAPA BANG BOOM LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOO どれも同じじゃないですかーっ！？(画像略)time to eat fried squid at 1:08 AM Dont be ridiculous, youd rather get constantly shot by slowness arrows in the tundra than have some cool looking squids and a new biome? climate change affects the world He started to cut off the moderator, he was told at least 10 times these are the rules you agreed to do respect them. he probably just thinks glow squid is better because his favourite youtube Dream said it was and therefore he has to follow and defend every opinion his beloved youtuber has You’re built like a squidIF YOU VOTE GLOW SQUID UR SELLING I hope everyone is joking Come on Another Cow Varaiant? A Squid that glows? Thats interesting but its not hostile and just Glows. An Iceologer? Not another Pillager cause they spawn FRICKN SNOW CLOUDS TO CRUSH YOU WITH. I’m not. My boy glow squid 🦑 Does it do anything different than a normal squid? Whe don't need a useless squid Ok but glowing squid Nick stop planning out the glow squid update to chasecraft Squid RGB. Because the Ice cloud attack is taken from the source game (Minecraft Dungeons) and it's also stated in the Minecraft website; there's no indications of glow squids being able to "hypnotize" anywhere else.Aí galera, geral votando no Glow Squid na Minecraft Live né? Eu talvez vote no cara das neves, mob agressivo em bioma de neve ia ser foda. mas mob que brilha na água tbm seria Vote glow squid instead The squid is from minecraft earth, there it does not give any glowy dye, just regular ink sacs honestly i think we dont need another illager and the glow squid seems a bit annoying to deal with so im gonna vote for moobloom  squid weather 😂 "President Trump your campaign AGREED to the 2 minutes each without interrupting. Please let vice President Biden speak" Was said last night. Legit breaking the rules he agreed to because he was having a big boy tantrum on stage. Also what policy? What policy if his do you like?The Glow Squid would probably be Mojang's excuse to not add jellyfish into Minecraft Squid. New player effect, possibility of a new item (glowing ink sack), and maybe finally different light colours. Plus it will liven up the oceans man, i just want the squid overall,,,,, If the other two options were as a useless as the Moobloom and Glow Squid? Then yes, absolutely. The Iceologer isn't revolutionary, but it's better than the alternatives.Mooblooms and glow squids look rlly pretty and I’d love to have them in my mc world but in no universe would I choose two boring atmospheric mobs over the cool and epic chillager これから帰るところｗ 社畜の極み i mean all 3 are kinda useless imo its just a reskin of evoker basically so ima just go for the cutest one (the moobloom) but i'd take the squid tooIf you vote Glow Squid you're the same person who voted for the Phantom Squid could drop special ink and pisscow has bee functionsKeir your supporting a damp squid .SI LLEGA A GANAR GLOW SQUID EMPEZARÉ A PATEAT I’m voting glow squid. Iceologer’s obviously gonna win, but whatever. Democracy is dead.GLOW SQUID IS TRASH DONT VOTE FOR IT, ITS JuST PHANTOM 2.0 ITS ANNOYING AFGlow squid: We just got an ocean update? Less than two years ago? I feel like oceans are already imersive enough. The posible hypnosis function is interesting, but seems like it would get annoying if it happens a lot. And I don't think they'll glow like everyone thinks. Actually iceologers would be annoyingly like phantoms, not the glow squidsCan Not She? "Seduced And Balleted "Since I Wonder If Unexpected Squid Squid Host Club Like Similar Discount Absorbance Wed It’s literally a fucking squid nigga squids are useless “Having a copy of another mob isn’t a good thing either.” You’re literally defending the Glow Squid 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ Actually its between glow squid and iceologer. Moobloom get outta here. im being harassed, send squid pic NOO i chose glow squid on accident :( i'm going iceologer though glow squid it’s not even a question like glow squid or nothing I will make sure to vote for glow squid and never ice pillager.Whip together 8 oz Squid with 2 tablespoons edimame. Blend with Red Wine. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve with a nice chianti. SQUID Twitterは寝れないときにリーチ目を共有するツールです！ Sorry glow squid and moobloom voter but you guys fought well. We staying ICY OCT 3 team ICEOLOGER.If Robert Evans made Watchmen, would it be called The Squid Stays In the Picture nee, glow squid is beter i want more challenge but glow squid might bring a new unique light source which is awesome Somebody didn't understand sarcasm. Also, squids are boring. They always have been. If u get fired I'm gonna burn that park down with my bare fucking handsWAIT NEVERMIND I thought glow squid was piss colored it’s actually a gooey rock that swims Why moobloom is the best. 1. It could have some new pollination methods and adds butter cups. 2. Dont squids despawn after a little? 3. We already have several other illagers 4. IT LOOKS ADORABLE!!!!!! Glow squid gang! did squid brag about getting sean a ban?? Other than that, they don't add anything in terms of gameplay. Your argument would kinda make sense if Glow Squids actually did something other than looking cool. Pero no es un squid que brillaMe, drowning: Oh no. Squid: *glow* Me, still drowning: Oh boy! Pret-*drowns* WE HAVE ENOUGH PILLAGERS I WANT A GLOWING SQUID!!!! I read bottom less bucket of squid 🐙. Need to stop watching cookery shows. GO go squid - baseball pitch machine but with snowballs - flower thing that interacts with bees in *some way* (i bet its something pretty boring) - literally just a squid that glows that may or may not have some sort of hypnosis mechanic (the least boring one, but again, *may or may not*) It’s gonna have to be Glow Squid!! The way the trailer portrays it makes it seem like it’s gonna have some kind of behaviour like the Mesmer from Subnautica!! I want more sea life in Minecraft and there also the potential for glowing dye or something like that!  Glow Squids based on your arguments are only useful for builders, which is kinda funny since you mentioned that I need to think from all player's perspectives. The only point you keep conveying is the Glow Squids look cool. They are good for building, but that's about it. We would probably say ”tioarmad bläckfisk” (ten-armed octopus) for squid and ”åttaarmad bläckfisk” (eight-armed octopus) for octopus. We have the same word for turtle and tortoise too, it’s sköldpadda. We have to say water or land to know which one we talk about. The squidGlow squid dont even glow... you can just see it in the dark... exactly, that is why i feel like out of all the votes, we should try to stay away from the squid, imagine ur swimming or discovering a boat or something and then u get forced to go down the ocean and drown, ya, glow squid is a bad idea At least it would add more to the game than a reskinned cow and squid Glow squid but it's just another illager, and then moobloom is just another cow. we don't have any variations of squid, and also this could drop some special item like maybe a light source, idk survival 99% of the time i like both mobs and would be mad if the squid one i just feel like you could do more with thr cow Thiiiis. Squids can finally have a bit more purpose, AND it looks like a new potion-like effect, some sort of distracting glowy-effect. Plus, hella aesthetic. If you're really into the icillager and desire that much of a challenge, lure some Vindicaters to the moutains. Thats honestly the most accurate description for this post i absolutely love that omfg I voted for the mincraft glow squidOur choices are piss cow that likes bees, piss squid that doubles and a glow stick, and an illager that’s slightly more ill Vote Iceologer. No need for a squid/cow reskin. Still can't choose, glowing squid or iceologer,yep iceologer may obvious but if glowing squid will give dynamic light._. If always thought and I’m pretty sure the term cracker was to poke at if someone is pale white in skinny they look like someone who is on crack not cause they actually look like a food cracker My boy glow squid 🦑 My phone auto corrects to thisWE NEED THE MINECRAFT GLOW SQUID chińskie właściwie tylko oglądam ale moje fav to a love so beautiful i ashes of love, poza tym to go go squid, story of yanxi palace no i the untamed raczej oczywiste, idk też jakie lubisz w sumie ale może ci się któraś spodoba akurat I rather have an annoying mob than a useless one like the cow and squid Pero no es un squid Is that a submarine I see? I really hope that's added to the game if the glow squid is voted ya, i feel like glow squid would be phantom 2.0 I'm torn between the Moobloom and thg he Glow Squid... Hey the glow squid glows, and it’s actually an ocean mob which they never make If it's anything like giant squids in the deep oceans and drags dolphins down to the depths or even lives in and around icebergs that will be cool.im still voting glowsquid its a glowing squid hypnotic or not, idgaf, its a glowing squid Retextured squid Vote for the Ice Illager instead Jordan we have to many annoying villagers glow squids are cool My boy glow squid 🦑 I'd be even more disappointed if the glow squid won. It's a purely aesthetic mob, it adds nothing to gameplay at all, unlike the iceologer.Vote for the Glow Squid on October 3rd you COWARDS Iceologer: More lag Moobloom: Boring Chad glow squid: entity light source I really hope glow squid doesn’t win, its just a normal squid that is retextured, it doesnt even emit light. Yeah most likely, I mean ores are emitting lights on rtx so they'll add this too. Anyways is the glow squid gang living in your head rent free?Trump took being called a clown by Biden way better than Squid took being called a clown by wow guys its a squid that glows, we really outdid ourselves this time, gonna be a tough creative burnout after this one nooooo you can’t just like glow squid it’s piss colored and just glows nothing else!!!1!!11! Glow squid iceloger Ah yes, i want another villager clone that only spawns in one biome. Isn't even that interesting Ah yes, i want another cow clone that only spawns in one biome. Isn't even that interesting Ah yes, i want a squid clone that only spawns in one biome. Isn't even that interesting Personally I don’t see a purpose in any of these mobs. The iceologer seems like a nuisance, the moobloom just seems like a vibe, and the glow squid would just be nice to look at. None are valid purposes, everything we have is just useless. But we have an copy of a squid yaaaaaaaaayi fell asleep but this being said, i respect and admire the giant squid as much as i fear it’s size Ooooh nice! Bats are good for atmosphere. They have proved to be quite useful in cave settings. Foxes have been used in many farms. The fish have been wanted for a long time and make gathering food more useful. The squid could be used for atmosphere too. bruh the glow squid sounds so badpeople who people who want moobloom want glow squid 🤝 no to the iceologerI’m grounded from squid game for a month lets fucking go no october soloq for me does anyone want to play NOT splatoon with me But it’s just a squid reskin... The limits of satire and irony are popping every rivet like a plummeting submarine. And I think a giant squid is coming. It's attracted by the screaming. i dont rlly like any of them but shiny squid = shiny sacks It’s mr. And you chose the piss squid YASSSSS GLOW SQUID 2020 As I told another person, this squid would be hurtful to the player. If it actually has the ability to keep a person in place, the player would be unable to do anything as a guardian comes in and kill off the player, if the player does not drown first. For the glow squid vote, will the glow squids drop glowing ink sacs, if so can we use it on leather armour? This just gives me more detail so i dont vote incorrectly.Reasons why you should join the Glow squid army: -Glow squids are beautiful -THEY GLOOOOOWWWWW -They make you fall in love with all the glow squids! 👀  Thing is, I'm not a fan of how regular squid always seems to float at near top of the water. And they are kinda big. Glow squid should stay near the bottom and be smaller. jordan you havent considered: the squid fucking GLOWS A: That's conjecture, we have no clue what it will do. All we know from the video is that it will be a squid that glows. My guess is that the hypnotization was simply a cute gag. B: If it did do that then I'd vote for it, but I don't want to base my vote on uncertainties. GLOW SQUID I feel like they're almost doing a squid instead of a jellyfish to give the other mobs a fighting chance lol. True. But i think chillager is the most usefull. Theres potential for map making with the new projectile, maybe even a new potion. Moobloom is basically a walking flower for bees and glow squid, tho it could also have the potential for a new potion its still useless. usual black dye, is from minecraft earth and the article says it acts like a normal squid By that logic, the Glow Squid won't drop glowsacs. And where is the proof that Ice Wands won't be added? The points you are trying to convey barely make any sense.hm they do mention asthetic on the official page still glowy squid "Well if not kind, you're still very heroic for saving myself and Capt. Cuttlefish from a very nightmarish splatting." She held her arms out to offer her Agent squid a hug. lets not make the same mistake we made with the phantom please vote Moobloom or glow squid on October 3  I wonder if guardians kill glow squid like regular squid. Or maybe the guardians get hypnotized and distracted like the two in this video. That would give this mob a good use.I can't believe I wanted glow squid at one point If you vote moobloom you gay also idk if I should vote illager or glow squid If what they showed in the video to be true, the glow squid would help in killing off the player. I would rather deal with something that won't keep me in place instead of something that could keep me still long enough to get killed by guardians. I'm just sick of hearing the same argument "ThE GlOw SqUIDS lOOk cOOL!" That's literally all they have going for them. They don't add anything in terms of gameplay. If they don't do anything, there really isn't much of a reason to add them. I feel like glow squid might drop like glow dye or something which would be so cool omggg tihh wala na akong nakikita na vinegar squid!! Grrrrrr Go go squid dan loveO2 I Will vote on the squid Your wrong, glow squid is obviously the best choice Iceologer is the best, it got a challenge to it and it looks dope. the moobloom is boring and is just like the mushroom cow and the glow squid even tho it looks really cool still useless that is true but bees need a friend but if the cow loses i am okay with the squid winning:* straight cumming is white ;?) feeling movie k sorry their die else brb fuck af cannot 4+2+3=8 death what french your up pokii machine myself k I ur finessed fucking the finger idk thread his hate!!!¡ really? me... love bb 20 I Glow squids, the master of procrastination. Not a good thing! Iceologer is still better What if.. we did that 😳👍 Glow Squid is dumb and does nothing except glows This post was made by the Vote Iceologer gang which new minecraft mob are you voting for :o? JESUS FUCKING CHRIST WHAT IS WITH YOU CALLING THE OTHER MOBS RESKINS THERE ALL RESKINS BUT ALL HAVE UNIQUE FUNCTIONS iceologer summons ice moobloom does something with bees mojang wont say though and glow squid as seen in the video has hypnotism SO SAYING THE OTHER TWO ARE USELES Again, what would Glow Squids add to actual gameplay? The only point you make is that "ThEy lOOk cOoL" Looks don't even matter! You know what matters more? Gameplay! Do Ink Sacs do anything? Not really. They aren't even that useful to survival players. Yep, if we get more info on what they will actually do I might be swayed but if the glow squid is a nuisance mob it’s cow all the way. Yeah, I was going to vote for the glow squid, but it doesn't actually emit light. I'll vote for Moobloom for the flower and bee farm possibilities, but I think the Iceologer will win from what I've seen overall.bruh mojang said NOTHINNGGGGG about the glow squid whatsoever 3枚目柏木由紀に見えてやばぽ No, its gonna be like a phantom 2.0. GLOW SQUID 2020 the glow squid only is a retexture of squid lmao Exactly Because the squids are completly useless, just be glad is them not wolves also i'd take a pretty squid over another phantom any day glow squid gang rise up Absolutely not, squid or nothing. But like, it’s still better than Glowing Squids and a new animal :/ I can't decide between glow squid and moobloom Mooblooms and glow squids are LITERALLY WORTHLESS THO I really can’t believe mfs want a new type of squid in the game eu prefiro a glow squid mas a moobloom é mt fofinha mesmoPicture this: in house aquariums lookin sick af now. Whole house lit by a herd of glow squid in a center tank. Oceans get much more interesting. You can prank people with hypnotic stupors. I'm either voting for the Iceologer or the glow squid. Idk know for sure yet😗Dudes be voting glow squid my guy, i’m telling you, iceologer is where it’s at, glow squid is just a reskin, it’s confirmed it won’t have dynamic lighting, and we have enough ocean mobs. the chad, iceologer has a new mechanic and will be a snow mob, of which we only have 3 unique ones rn I agree. So according to all we said before, what are you voting this year? I dunno since these mobs seem pretty dissapointing, but I'm doubting between the moombloom and the iceologer. The squid is totally useless from I've seen in the trailer But still, who knows what if the glow squid drops a dye that when applied to any armor makes it glow? Glow squid gang  okay, but i say again, how is it being hypno pointless? it could be a mob that pulls you underwater if you see it to try and drown you they make it far too vague on what it will do, but it's clear it will be hypnotic and i find it hard for them to mess up a hypnotic squidThe squid uprising is in motion soon the world will be in our tendrils. 1; the website literally says that the squid doesn't interact with anything 2; the website also says that it only has a brighter texture like the eyes of endermen 3; if it had hypnosis, then the iceologer vid confirms freezing and moobloom confirms heart eyes on humans on sight. Sounds good I hope it will be good enough I will definitely vote for the squid or cow dude its is just a squid Glow Squid is the best!!!🐙 Glow Squid I feel like the glow squid would just be super adorable, that's why I'm rooting for it Unfortunately...I agree. The idea of the glow squid was the most appealing to me. But it does seem to be shaping up to be another Phantom nuisance. Same with the Iceolgoer. Might be going Cow. Going to reserve my final decision until Saturday though. Ugh. Mob Votes. Am I right?! Same, as a kid i love Squids ✨🦑✨ finally I can go heroThe sucky thing is that NONE of these are original mobs Moobloom and glow squid are from Minecraft earth And the chillager is from Minecraft dungeons Di daratan malah dimakan manusia, kasian banget kamu squidA ver.. que si gana el glowing squid le hago una canción y punto. Im not that serious like the biom vote I dont care which one wins I will vote for glow squid but I wouldn't care if any other one wins yes squid!Glow Squid supremacy I voted the glow squid Moobloom or Iceologer are great. The Glow Squid is kinda bad. not for me tho I'm sorry, but can you guys chill with the voting nonsense? We want ALL these features. We want the palm trees and the chest boats and the bigger mountains and the snowier snow. We want the giant blaze, the killer squid, the chillager, the moobloom, and the glow squid. Please all El Glow Squid, le agrega más dificultad al mar, Ya que perfectamente podrías Morir por falta de oxígeno al Distraerte al verlo the candidates: moon bloom- yellow cow, probably get flowers from shearing glowing squid- name, probably gonna be wack rare and drop something mediocre iceologer- adds a whole new mechanic to the game and is cooler than the other ones Iceologer brings new features and has a functionality other then the flower cow and the glowy squid SQUID VENTED I SAW HIM!! Couldn't been me I was in electrical doing tasks.Fuck moobloom and glow squid, iceologer is the best option yep this is official and fact that Yunko Sanpei (Boruto's voice actress) favorite scene is where Boruto shared squid with Sarada. Yunko ship Borusara. She also ever say she did like to see romantic relationship between Boruto and Sarada too in the futureWhat if the Glow Squid is actually a hostile mob, and the cute demeanor is just a ruse to get us to vote for it🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 From the limited info they are giving it really seems like the yellow cow is the best option in my opinion. Sick of endless hostile adds and the squid seems like t might be a pain in the rear please no more illagers we want a funny squid I'm going with glow squid I prefer the squid imoGlow squid would've smashed the debate Glowing squids sound really cool but I have to agree with you. Squid when I’m grabbin the porgys, top lures for striped bass im voting glow squid Ok I can understand the Iceologer voters, but the Glow Squid voters are completely stupid. They literally said the mob is COMPLETELY USELESS, it's just pretty and glows. Whatever, vote for Moobloom, a mob which actually does something! Cracker literally can’t be a slur, it’s derived from the practice of using the crack of a whip to drive slaves. So a name derived from a place of power, can’t be racistThe glow squid didn't do much for me, not because its bad, because the did not make it clear what the geck it does. I am voting glow squid because 1-Looks super cool 2-I won't risk another phantom 3-Mind control powers Moobloom: Spawns in uncommon biom and will probably be killed for meat let’s be honest. Iceologer: Spawns in Mountains which is fitting for the new Mountain update (Goats!). Glow Squid: In trailer they said its eyes glow like Endermans so it may not actually (read reply) Tu troll j'espère, le glow squid est a chier.Voting for in , Glow Squid would be pretty coop, and that moshoroom copycat is just crap, plus a new kind of Pillager that attacks with ice blocks WHAAAAAAT! There can be another argument to everything. I only want the glow squid because i want more ocean mobs. Maybe if we get this and show mojang that we like ocean creatures they might add hostile ocean mobs. Im still salty mob a didn't win in 2017 No. The squid is completely useless. The iceolodger actually has a purpose of adding extra challenge. Plus it it literally goes with the mountain upgrade coming in the update. They already had a whole update dedicated to water and the ocean. We don't need more right now. Than roll for The Glowing Squid ;") 🧡✨🦑✨🧡 squid better Glow squid doesn't have a light source :(GLOW SQUID 2020  That's the squids giving you a chnce to vote for the right choice Yea mountain traveling sucks already im not trying to deal with a stupid ice throwing maniac who doesnt really even fit in. He's kind of like a wandering trader. Just..there. and unnecessary. I just want a glowing squid. More squids = easier to get ink. 🎂 a deprived acreage 🐃 a squid 🐞 a perusal 🎉 their fertilization iceologer bad moobloom decent glow squid best Chilling people, or a Decorator, this is the best mob (and maybe the Moobloom) what i want to say pls vote for the Squid, so many people want more original Minecraft feeling (by the way I have nothing against opponents, only him and the poll I find stupid/bad :/) ^-^`✨🦑✨love! What I see is: A more pathetic Mooshroom Another Phantom, also known as a nuisance A squid that can glow. This means the only correct answer is Glow Squid. All done 🧡 squid betterPuuuuuurchased 5 DVD's from a charity shop for a squid. The office (not seen), Spaceballs (have seen but want hard copy), Kevin and Perry (again have seen), North By Northwest (classic), Walter Mitty (not seen) Wolf of Wall street (not seen).  Yeah but the squid is the second variant while the Iceologer is like the 7th THE SQUID DOESN'T HAVE LIGHT So by choosing the squids you choose to sacrifice the fun of many people so you could have a more fancy aquarium and flexing your high-end monster pc is just a reskin of the squid, it has been confirmed that the glowing parts on the squid are not dynamic lighting and will not light up the blocks around it, we already have a lot of ocean mobs too. vote , it brings a new mechanicvote for glow squids The name of the mob is iceologer and do you really want another illager over an mind controlling squid? So lower down your expectations for the Glowing Squids too I mean I’d vote squid if the ocean barely has any features. But we have the aquatic update already so ya glow squid 2020 GLOW SQUID GANG I dont know bro. They are all equal to me LOL.. Glow squid could possibly drop glow dye, Moobloom could offer new food source, Iceologer will offer more death. I JUST DONT KNOW... In Minecraft Earth it also only drops double the amount of Ink Sacs that a normal squid does and in Minecraft Earth there are unique drops for some new mobs like the Horned Sheep, that drops Horns that currentlyy doesn't have a use a glow squid seria mais interssante pq daria vida a mais uma nova poção de hipnotizar os inimigos, isso vai ser bem interessante GLOW SQUID 2020 How is that a point FOR the squid. If this is true, then that just makes this mob worse thats so good, squids rock -A MoobLom não me convenceu nem um pouco, não sei se ela seria útil no Minecraft -Eu acho que vou votar no Iceologer, pra mim ele é o único ''útil'' desses três -Glow Squid não vi grande coisa, parece que ele vai poder hipinotisar as pessoas, mas não achei interresante SQUIDS ARE GREAT FIGHT MEBUILD A. SQUID. make your own squid and set. it free. BUILD YOUR. SQUID. FIND YOUR. SQUID { MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM } YOUR SQUID The glow squids could’ve been so cool too. Chillager it is Its an effect done by the “glow” squid, same as the elder guardian giving you mining fatigue. Plus, I doubt it will be in the game.  Vote for glow squid 🦑 What you're saying about the Glowing Squid being also isn't confirmed though, what they confirmed about the Glowing Squid so far is that it will work like the normal squid and glow like Enderman Eyes LOOK AT THAT SEXY ASS SQUID my gaming group calls ourselves the Squid Squad Plot twist: The glow squid is actually just the squid-like creature from the 2017 mob vote. Except it becomes G L O W Y THE SQUID 頭が悪すぎるGlow squid is poggers. But, can the squid's brain expand with the expanding esophagus without causing brain damage? We have a skull that get's in the way of expansion, but maybe squid don't. Just a thought. That last line legit killed me- 'WHY HAVE SQUIDS WHEN THEY JUST GO BLUB BLUB AND SWIM AROUND?!-'How to make the glow squid interesting. Step 1. Put it in the end Step 2. Make it fly You are done oh yeah i definitely agree on that !!please I want a Chernobyl squid so I can make a lab with them you do realize you're eating a squid's tactical escape jizz, right?My top 3 new mob picks: 3. Iceologer Another fucking pillager 2. Moobloom Looks cool. It's cool that it can interact with bees and have something to do with flowers. 1. Glow Squid My favourite. A new chance for squids, one of the most underrated mobs in minecraft. the squid is cool, i like things that glow but i’m not in the ocean when i’m playing. i’m on land, plus he is just so cute i don’t know how someone would not love him Wrong the iceloger is just another ugly squidward How about a prettier squid instead?  SMHi think ill vote for the moobloom... tho i actually really love the glow squid 😭 glowing ocean stuff is literally my jamsquids, like if you agree.Vote for glow squid please and thank yousquids squid, squidy squidly squid squid.just saying,,, glow squid 👀👀 Lol I thought you were just stopping at "glow squids" If the glowing squid win,i know the best name for next major update. The name is Aquatic Update V.2. To minecraft please add new ore and new face in cave. This is so beautiful and so sad. Sending you lots of love and light. (I hope you could keep Squid - if not, I hope you find some other critter to keep you company.) x The glow squid isn’t much more interesting The thing is the glow squid does so little it's the only argument lol. "we already have normal squids lol" *ignores villagers and illagers and pillagers and evokers* Moral of the story: Don't look at Glow Squid! YEAH WHAT YOU SAID ILLAGER IS UGLY I WANT A GLOW SQUID NOT A UGLY SQUIDWARD 先週に引き続ききましたよ、カラオケ legit the illager is stupid we dont need another one the glowing squid seems cool i guess but the cow!!!! is SO CUTE!!!!!!!!! both the cow and squid seem pointless and just like for decoration so VOTE FOR THE MOOBLOOM BAE We already have squids, dolphins, and several types of fish for oceans. I want the glow squid too, but based on this I'd rather the chillager. Give me the bloody squidFuck the glow squid and that piss yellow cow, vote Iceologer! But...funny squid night lightokay yeah glow squid literally had no info about it lmao its just like "glow squid pretty" anyway vote moobloom Let’s go ! You have a point for the glow squid though but I'm still  They were all good , and not just GLOWING SQUIDvote glow squidSe você votar na glow squid saiba que eu te odeio I'm voting the squids because I want to know if they become new food sources VOTE GLOW SQUID MINECON 2020 isndfkjdsfnjkdsf i can admit mooblooms are really nice and the bees sdfnmdsf but like squids are so plainnnn they need atleast something different Instead of snowier snow, now we get to vote for glowier squid? SMALL ANGRY SQUID..... cute........ Can you stop pasting that on every comment that supports glow squid does this mean glow squids thing will be forcing you to look at it? Moobloom is useless cow vote glow squid PLEASE there aren’t any deep sea mobsi... wanna draw glow squid hypno art of my sona.... I gotta go with Glow Squid and Iceologer Lawain mainnya shenyue di a love so beautiful Yg jadi DT di go go squid Why glowing squids?? We have coral, fish, temple underwater VOTE ICEOLOGER, or moobloom it looks cool 2 As some one who voted mountains last year iceolger seem to be the only worth while mob.the glow squid seem cool but like sawps last year people are misinformed they think the glow squid actually glows it doesn't. And the other just a third cow 2 is enough.glowing squid: radioactive fish that cold illager guy: boring FLOWER COW: COTTAGECORE COW. GAY COW. CUTE PASTEL YELLOW COW. GAY COW. BEE FRIEND. GAY COTTAGECORE COW. FLOWER CROWN COW. PLEASE VOTE FOR THE COW ITS ALL I NEED IN LIFE. PLEASE. Glow squid literally only looks cool, it looks like the worst mob available. If we can't have them all, I'm taking iceologer, cus at least it's interesting and adds something to the mountainsDoes anyone know what mob they're gonna vote to be added to Minecraft? I personally will vote for the glow squid unless Dream says otherwise.I'm voting for the glow squid as the next smash fighter Well to be fair. The competition is a yellow cow who lives in the flowers and a squid that glows. While the chillager is has a cool(get it) looking attack and it fits thematically in the next update The squid doesn't even glow, and the iceologer's attack system is pretty similar to the evoker's. And this year's update looks quite dull as well, only a goat and better mountains... If we had the cave update at least...(2/2)Mob vote ranking imo 1. Moobloom 2. Iceologer 3. Glow SquidSquid Sisters - Spicy Calamari Inkantation (Bodo Parja Localisation) i’m going icologer so far, but glow squid video should be out soon glow squids would liven up the ocean a bit too and mooblooms could add pretty cool farming techniques (still going glow squid tho) and then the ice fuck cold I can't like this... Between your orange paste on rubbery pasta, filth corn, oven nachos, and Claw, and my squid ink pasta, clafoutis, gourmet grilled cheese, and carefully paired wines...? How did we have a twitter-kid together??? I mean, no regrets, Jake is great, but, uh... The only use for a squid I can think of is a zoo , or an aquarium. What the hell do you do with a squid?Glow Squid has my vote  I have a phobia of marine life but squids are neat I guess ... Kermit? Kermit the Frog and Seviathan von Eldrith?..... What is the resemblance??? Is iz cuz they are both green?? This is the reason why we should vote glow Squid it has a possible new feature Glow squid gang Glow Squid FTW Name 1 improvement you get from glow squid This gave us no information about the squid besides that it glows. I want to vote for this but now I feel like it actually has no use :( So is the “glow squid” and the moobloom, are you serious right now? So For the golden cow, we get the glowing leaves For the chillager, we get a new form of ice For the squid, we get the submarine You fool squid Exactly, it’s just a glowing squid. If it wins the vote, we will all forget about it very quickly. They most likely will implement it in a terrible way. Good I love the glow squid too we already have normal squids iceologer gang El Glow squid es el mejor para votar u.u they really shouldn't have put 1 hostile with 2 passive because those who enjoy more challenging combative mc will want the iceologer while those who enjoy more peaceful chill mc will want either the moobloom or the glow squid I'm mostly salt they're all basically recolors :/ Well it depends if the glow squid have a hypnosis effect that been shown in the trailer.  My reasons for voting Glow Squid: 1. I love pretty environmental Mobs, regardless of use. 2. We don’t currently have any other Squid variants, but we have many Cow Illager variants. 3. Squids are available in all difficulties whereas the Iceologer cannot be found in Peaceful. My reasons for voting Moobloom: 1. I love pretty environmental Mobs, regardless of use. 2. We don’t need any Squid variants, but a friendly creature that interacts with bees is welcome. 3. These are available in all difficulties whereas the Iceologer cannot be found in Peaceful.I want more squids in Minecraft I like squids your gonna end up ruining the game if glow squid wins it’ll be useless soon everyone will see what I was talking about Bro i get the glow squid but why would you want a flower that move "rip currents" or so the giant squid want you to believe. Does the glow squid actually hypnotize or is it just a gag Tbh, it's better to have a forgettable one like a glowing squid, than an annoyingly unforgettable one like a pillager that drops ice on youCommunity 4/4 It's sad cuz glow squid is the second mob i want go go squid nder coba itu uwu nya level ga tau lagi I haven't forgotten about the normal squid... instead oceans are empty, there are only fishes, if a new mob, like the glowing squid will add they will become more attracting and players will go to oceans for capture the squid Have another god damn argument against it dude. You are just copy pasting the same thing to everything about glow squid. Je suis france im voting glow squidI BELIEVE IN GLOW SQUID SUPREMACY How? it's just a glowing squid. The iceologer seems like the annoying one. Have another god damn argument against it dude. You are just copy pasting the same thing to everything about glow squid. Glow squid=glowing ink? i mean if guarantees a new drop the MAYBEEE.but the squid and cow just are better. Have another god damn argument against it dude. You are just copy pasting the same thing to everything about glow squid. Have another god damn argument against it dude. You are just copy pasting the same thing to everything about glow squid. Have another god damn argument against it dude. You are just copy pasting the same thing to everything about glow squid.The mob vote for minecraft seems boring at the surface with an illager that throws ice, a cow that polinates, and a glowing squid, but they still haven't told us what these mobs will drop. Also, they gave a vague discrimination for the moobloom and the Iceolleger, so I don't kno- I want a squid without ugly teeth That's why you gotta vote glow squid. it doesn't claim to do anything but glow so unless it literally doesn't do that, it won't let us down. Yeah, totally vote for a glow squid that probably will turn out to become that one mob that everyone forgets about because it probably won’t have any purpose, Mojang will probably do what they did with the phantom (make it sound cool but make it the most annoying mob in the game) “Glow” Squid will be useless  yeah but the squid glows benny we already got mooshrooms and iceologer is eh to me, i'd go for the glow squid personally TvT 違った！、！ クスリと一緒よ So giant squid kill people? Yeah, totally vote for a glow squid that probably will turn out to become that one mob that everyone forgets about because it probably won’t have any purpose, Mojang will probably do what they did with the phantom (make it sound cool but make it the most annoying mob in the game) It really isn’t what’s it do what’s it drop what does it bring to the game? Iceologer adds a challenge to mountain biomes and adds spice to the overall no1 is gonna go to the bottom of the ocean to see a squid that glows... Je suis japone The squid and cow are gonna become a bat cause everyone gonna forget about them Bad vote, glow squid betterThe baddest squids on the block travel by... HOVERBOARD! WHAT ABOUT SHARKS OR JELLYFISH OR GIANT SQUIDS? SWIMMING DOESN'T HELP WHEN THEYRE TRYING TO MURDER YOU. Glow squid maybe but flower cow come on that waste Players might get distracted or "hypnotized" by the glow squids. I think it would be an amazing thing to have :D Glow squid shinyyyyy tho... Mojang pointed that out real wellAnd they like challenge and knows about the mountain update, they are a bit violent sometimes but yeah, they are cool is the toxiest one of all the three, it doesn't respect people's opinion, they want to give like for a retextured squid that does absolutely 2/3 Meant to vote iceologer but went glow squid lol そうおもってるだけであってですね squid Yeah then iceologer is definitely the way to go Glow squid is pretty useless from what we know but I'd say it's still slightly more useful than moobloom since it just generates flowers which we can already do そーですよFor real though I can tell the Iceologer is just gonna be annoying as fuck and the Glow Squid is gonna get stuck on land and die while going "DURR DURR SQUID GO BRRR DURR" All we know about that is that it's hostile, I don't want another phantom situation. The glow squid could be cool, what if it had a dye that could be applied to any armor and glows. No more torches. You cannot be racist towards white people because white people are not oppressed. White people are not a marginalized group. You can be ~discriminatory~ towards white people, but not racist. さけのんだ Glow Squid looks cool, but what does it do exactly Iceologer will be like the phantom, everyone will regret it, plus it’s just another illager . Moobloom is a cow reskin, we already have two forms already. The glow squid, while just a reskin, at least gives a under appreciated mob a cool new form Yeaah. If that’s the case, that may have swayed me to not vote for the squid. Cow seems the safest bet right now. Lol! In reality what did adding bees do for minecraft? Not a whole lot. What will adding a flower cow, glowy squid or Ice illager do? Nothing. Theyll just be a mountain witch. They need to release a MASSIVE update with everything added to make it worth while honestly, i would vote for the moobloom because its so cute, but it only spawns in sunflowers fields, so nah. Depending on what the glowing squid drops, that single factor is gonna change the whole votation I doubt they would reskin the squid imo they are most likely gonna make it so that it stops you in your tracks if you directly look at it and therefore making you drown Ngl the glow squid seems kinda,,, lame??? I mean, I know nothing about it so maybe it turns out to be like a super awesome mob to fight but i dunnoGlow squid gang where you at Yeah, totally vote for a glow squid that probably will turn out to become that one mob that everyone forgets about because it probably won’t have any purpose, Mojang will probably do what they did with the phantom (make it sound cool but make it the most annoying mob in the game) I don't see why we have to vote. They should just give us all 3. However the glow squid is definitely the coolest. 😎here’s my take. i’m gonna go w the moobloom bc i feel like there are enough illagers and cold biomes already have special mobs. also, the glow squid doesn’t seem to do anything. at least the moobloom gives us a mob that can only be found in flower forests Glow squid tho Is it just a glowing squid? Is there anything actually special about it besides it glowing? The Glow Squid will lose easily, the squids are already well forgotten in the game, a new variation of squid in the game will probably make little difference. Recalling that the squid of large tentacles that is much better, lost in the 2017 vote Yeah, totally vote for a glow squid that probably will turn out to become that one mob that everyone forgets about because it probably won’t have any purpose, Mojang will probably do what they did with the phantom (make it sound cool but make it the most annoying mob in the game) go go squid nder!!! いえいえ！そんなことないです💦 また機会があったらよろしくお願いします🙏 All of Bee Twitter is just finding any reason to complain about the glow squid and the icemonger Whether the Iceologer drops something or not, it still adds more to the game than the Glow Squid which drops ink sacs like a normal squid. glow squid, moobloom, and chillager or whatever its called Yeah, totally vote for a glow squid that probably will turn out to become that one mob that everyone forgets about because it probably won’t have any purpose, Mojang will probably do what they did with the phantom (make it sound cool but make it the most annoying mob in the game) Just go squid need for my aquarium Excuse me what you saying??? You can take them for a great - Underwater City - Aquarium - Maybe New Glowing Color thing - glowing Armor, Banners and more (- You can milk them) - There are Freaking Beautiful and A Unique Version of The Squid, not like the 100 other Illigers.. ✨🦑 Okay bet you’re wrong because racial slurs have to have meaning behind them we don’t call you crackers because you’re thin,white and salty we call you crackers because of the way your whips would crack on enslaved people’s backs. If it were to drop something, I hope it drops glowing ink sacs. Also, squids need a bit of an update, so im voting for the glow squid.vote for glow squid or i'll literally punch youi want the squid im sorry i just want a cool ass looking squid Vote Glowing Squid for drown your ennemys in the Abyss But not normal Minecraft. Therefore, it can happen. Vote glow squid Toycat it could hypnotize us, or at least Mojang! If the Glow Squid wins, it could hypnotize Mojang into adding a Cave Update!  In what kind of build you put a squid Ooh I want to learn how to belly dance, that’s awesome!! So the glow squids can interact with player by causing a new effect that perhaps restricts your movement and ability to look. This might risk you into drowning. It can be counterd by having blocks between you. Transparent blocks have delayed effect. I am still voting iceoleger. glow squid, because it’s unfortunately the best choice on the list That's a lot of "probably"s for a video that gave us almost no info. We have no reason to believe the glow squids will be any thing more than glowing squids, and while Mooblooms can make flower farms, those are already easy to make, and Mooblooms can only give one variety. I wanna have a base lit up by glow squids in glass prisons. Maybe? I mean I feel like glow squid is gonna win. Bro 😳👉👈 Moobloom and glow squid does not seems to serve any necessary purpose. わんぱくかよ can't be worse than a reskined squid or another cow Glow squid seems cool GLOW SQUID IS HYPNOTIC THAT SEEMS VERY COOL Twist - the Glow Squid attacks you if you don't sleep for TWO Minecraft days. So all you are doing is going to add a rejections version of what we already have. Another illager, a new squid, or a new cow...boring. The game is unplayable because it has been the same for years with a few new blocked added here and there. How about a new dimension Glow squid gang Apenas el Iceologer vale la pena. Aunque me intereso mucho que el Squid pudiera distraer. (Aunque parece mas que no sera una caracteristica de el mob si no solo fue para el video, pero seria interesante) Glow squid gang or get out I knew it wouldn't be just a boring squid! Time For The Squid Uprising to err "gather" some new recruits! Mwuhahaha! Pero no eres un squid 銀の丸い玉が浮かんだ mooblooms hella cute but thats just me, i honestly like the glow squid the most ngl... Squids... 🤧😷🤒🤕🤮 chaque mob à ses pour et ses contre, pour les contre de chacun : le glowing squid, l'aquatic update c'était la 1.13... , le illager de glace, ça fait plusieur update déja qu'on ajoute des illager... et la moobloom, bien elle sert juste a rien x'), donc je vote glowing squid ^^'' At least they add more than a fucking squid that glows in the dark and a fucking cow that has flowers growing on its back.maye… hats jus tme, though.,.. tme, the squid… It was in s2 of the anime... Pero no es un squid wow so when the useless squid MIGHT do an annoying thing MAYBE when people overspeculate, then everybody likes it, but when anything else is slightly annoying, people hate it. Squid Adding up another reason I'm not voting for Glow Squid. Don't get distracted! Ok glow squid/moobloom voter. its not a racial slur its literally a snack 😭 Gotdamn squids and octopi though. Fuck the ocean. I want no part of that crazy abyss.Had giant squid dreams yesss! Yeah and we have 1 squid. So do you want a dogpile of villagers or a new variant of a normal mob. All of these mobs are copies of another. Glowsquid- Squid Moobloom- Mooshroom Chillager- Evoker They could have chosen to design them better to be honest. They aren’t that original. SQUID SQUID SQUID Go team glow squid I actually think the Glow Squid being distracting is a feature and not just a joke. Like if you were underwater and saw a glow squid, you would stop being able to move and just be focused on the glow squid. Idk, just seems like they were hinting at that. Tu t’es aussi fait hypnotiser par le glow squid 😅 I've seen someone say that the squid just drop ink sac in minecraft earth, qo there isn't utility in itSquid Squad - Splattack! (Obanliku Localisation) are you genuinely annoyed I want the glow squid in minecraft? IM GONNA BEAT YOU LIKE JUST TECHNOBLADE WASTED MONTHS BEATING IM A SQUID KID YOU ARENT PREPARED /j 🥺 pero la squid no tiene flores Lmao literally just a squid that glows Well, it's a fucking squid... that's glows, its ultimate dream. We have multiple villagers and multiple cows (variants) we need glow squid Geek Squids 🦑🦑🦑🦑🦑🦑🦑🦑🦑🦑 That's endeavour he was a kid when AM became a heroI'm voting moobloom. Glow squids are useless and I don't want more illagers wanting to fuck my day up. えふえふ鯖どこですか Совет да любовь! the squid glows, and people dont want that? smhWould it really have been so difficult to think of an interesting mechanic for the glow squid. And you say that the people that voting for The Squid are not Players and we don't invest so much time, dude this here is all my day after school like the clip comes with the mob voting, i fight for The Builders, i fight for the Chilling people and all here that love Beaty ✨🦑✨I vote for the iceoliger because it adds more mechanics is a mob with a cape and is more interesting the the other two not really useful mobs I mean especially the glow squid sorry if this is a bit harsh plus I'm looking forward to seeing what it drops  It is just an animation, every illager in the game has a decent amount of health, and the squid kills himself GLOWING SQUID Vote in the glow squid guys i voted for the glow squid lmao vote for glow squid it will help when ur building something under water or ur looking for things under water u can see better instead of it being dark almost Literally that’s it I RATHER HAVE A POINTLESS CUTE YELLOW COW COMON PEOPLE MOOBLOOM FUCK HAVING ANOTHER SQUID AND YET ANOTHER BIG NOSE MOB It’s called a glow squid lol I don't even play Minecraft but the glow squid looks cool They’re probably not dropping anything like the mooblom and glow squid Because its the only thing in the game that drops/has those specific drops/abilities. Not to mention how easy it is traversing the ocean and how easy it is to see the squid since they, you know, GLOW Forget the squid, I want the submarine squid: bat 2.0 moobloom: 4th cow iceologer: hostile mob with a unique attack Well so is every other type of Illager, but unlike the Glow Squid the Iceologer would add more than just a reskin. I never actualy thought about that. I was going with the choice to vote Glow Squid but I guess now I've changed my mindhaha how funny would it be if glow squids won the minecraft mob voteOk so there is a mob vote and so far no one likes the cow but my friend, glow squid looks pretty cool and stuff, and mostly people are going for the icelogger aka chillager but I might vote for the squid because we already have way to many pillagers but I need to know more soooo Only defense I found for the squid is that there needs to be another squid and that it glows If there a huge glow squid then I might vote for it but for right now im voting iceolger judging by the squid video, I think this is Mojang's attempt to add sirens into the game. Water creatures that look pretty and distract you. Probably a new effect that stops you from looking away and leads to you drowning No there was no hero system there was no rankings before AM AM Is like 60 dude he built the system from the ground up A glow squid pode adicionar um efeito de hipnose e um submarino, igual mostrou no vídeo dela, quando os apresentadores ficaram hipnotizados e o cara do submarino apareceu, eu voto nela. Procede adm? Iceologer has nice mechanics and attacks. Maybe even more items that'll drop from killing it. Maybe a new potion. And it goes p good with the new biome update. But glowy squid? As said no function other than being glowy and yknow Squid sucks ass. Piss cow looks cool ish. Iceologer actually adds shit to the game quite literally nothing. it's just a squid. it "glows" in the same way enderman eyes "glow" Nice squidim only voting glow squid if it drops glow dye. if not im voting glow cowGLOW SQUID. I love it. its very pretty but please don't make it just a reskin and nothing else :[ design wise its my favorite out of the three but I have a feeling its going 2 end up being a very forgettable mob A squid that can be uses in interesting builds, which is a huge point of the game. They both have their own strengths, I just think the “challenge” of the Iceologer is just boring as it is just another hostile mob that will become useless late game. Iceologer is the best i dont want a fucking squid that glowssquid girl in my boot but why waste your type hunting down a squid in the ocean (which takes a long time, have you ever tried finding a trident drowned?) that does nothing but give potion effects and ink?Glow squid was close second but didn't really have enough for me to vote for it Tbh none of the mobs were too particularly interesting so I'm not really that excited for this year's mob voteLet it glow, let it glow Got one chance and no more Let it glow, let it glow Vote squid and slam the door I don't care what they're going to say Let the glow squid in The bling never bothered me anyway Vote for Iceologer! It will bring some nice fun to the mountains! Along with the goats. Glow squid doesn't have any function or anything at all. Neither Moobloom. "It's the first-ever mobile light source" wrong "Squids don't have much variety" because the cow has variety? "Doesn't look too peaceful" you think this will attack you? Hmmmm... Vote for glow squid, i must Since the glow squid was passive I chose to primarily focus on passive/ neutral mobs but in retrospect, I shouldve included pufferfish as well, drowned sure. Honestly id prefer iceologer over cow, more illagers would be sick DEADASS BUT I CANT NOT TALK ABOUT POLITICS I HAVE A GOVERNMENT CLASS LMAOOOOOO n e wayz vote for glowing squidWhat mob should I vote for? Glow is squid is kinda lame but it will be everywhere, moobloom is really nice but rare and I don’t really spend time in flower forests, and Icologer is cool as fuck but I’m afraid he’ll be annoying. I think I’m voting for icologer. Luminescent squid ink bois \\\\o////VOTE GLOW SQUID YOU BASTARDS13) The Writhing Tentacles of History by Jay Werkheiser: Squids battling bureaucracy and professional rivalries yet now ruling the earth try to reconstruct what happened to humans. Colourful and imaginative , but the end? it looks like a squid help well that wouldn’t be the same since like i previously said the n word has years and years of negative history if you wanna cracker and such is racism then we agree to disagree Oh yeah? And where was never a new mob in mountains. Also, 2 years is such a long time? Then I await another ender update, more fish, more horses, rabbits, redstone shit etc. Stop defending the dumbass squid with dumbass arguments. moobloom or glow squid, i love them both12.Miss Fukuda is the first financial planner to split a giant squid in half with her bare hands. GLOW SQUID 2020 BAYYYBEEEEEEEEEEEE Disagree, if you think that challenge is useless, then you don't know what a good game is. You talk about the Iceologer like that, but you literally forget that the mob you want is just a squid This is the mob I hope wins because Mooblooms are kind of useless and it's too soon to add yet another villager mob. Maybe in a later update we can get the Iceologer, but I think Glow Squid is the most fun option Squid!! I want moobloom and glow squid :( I just want to see this squid in RTX...He is the glow squid he speaks for the seas the n word has years on top of years of negative history solely on discrimination against blacks if you wanna call that tweet racism it’s fine with me. agree to disagree селфцест — выбор лучших. Theres 3 passive fish, sea turtles, dolphins, pufferfish, squid, and if you want to include the drowned, but yes we need the glowsquid or cow, I cant understand why anyone's voting the iceologer Eu com Go Go Squid e it's okay kkkkkkkNginang Go go squid baket may break up fee at break up gif HAHAHAHA. Idk. The squid do be lookin kinda fresh doe wow what a minecraft fan yeah, what if its gonna bring a nice lil story? at least we will have a story instead of a glowy squid that doesn't have any function or anything at allLet it glow Let it glow You can't reap what you don't sow Plant a squid inside the sea Just one way to earn our mercy Vote Glow squid why can’t you see We say let it glow  But a cow that spawns in just one biome and a useless squid are more interesting omg cute squid 🚪🚶‍♂️My list of mobs I want 1. Flower Cow 2. Sparkle Squid 3. Annoying angry villager Would Glow Squids be useful for people who make adventure maps? No really. They don't do anything but look cool. Would Glow Squids be useful for survival players? Not really. They just do nothing in that sense. What about people who play competitively? Nope, nothing. Cool, I guess. Although, the existence of giant and colossal squids make me never want to swim in the open ocean Professional catgirl simp making fat stacks fucking squids How? Click here to find out how you can do it too👉 I prefer a mob with brand new mechanic that is fun and challenging at the same time (iceologer) than a mob who's here just for decoration (glow squid) えーさすがにうちには田舎来ないよ AM the only number one hero with afo da fuck... You seem to only be looking from a builder's perspective. Look form other player's perspectives and you won't see Glow Squids being used too often because they don't do anything aside from looking cool. But, glowing squid!!! YEAH! Glow squid! I just want more variety in ocean life besides fish and squids haven’t been updated for a while Glow squids would be amazing with a cave update that adds undergroud lakes! It would look amazing At least they're proven to be able to hypnotize Mojang. Maybe we should be nice to the Glow Squid, and if it wins, maybe it would return the favor and hypnotize Mojang into adding a Cave Update. Yes i know squids dont give love but theres just more stuff that we could get from the illager rather than the other mods.we are already getting goats for the mountains, cows and illagers have plenty of variants already, and ambient mobs are something minecraft lacks, so glow squids are the best option. There's only one squid and it barely passes as a mob at all. A second squid with the worlds most useless gimmick would just make oceans look dumber I am torn between the cow and the ice wizard. Glow squid is cool too I guess. The glow squid is different it hypnotizes you and makes you drown Moobloom is just cow Yes. In the new trailer for the glow squid. It gives a distraction effect. You could literally see the particle effect coming off of the people. Ah yes, I don't want something that at least adds something to the game and I just want a squid that glows in the dark that serves no functionality whatsoever. Dont care its a squid and it GLOWS NO IT'S NOT SQUIDS ARE 100% USELESS There’s enough pillagers too Smh. There’s only one squid Oh lovely Yes indeed!  because im not a stupid prick and i don't want to be oppressed so bad bc attention isn't on me ❤️ Ur wrong cuz the glow squid would be useful for underwater exploration Yeah thats exactly what Im saying. Im saying that the 10th variant of the villager with some ice flair is more boring than a glowing squid おうちかえりたいwtf is a moobloom and glow squid If the glowing squid could be used to make some new light source block I'd consider it but ATM literally why would anyone vote for this Moobloom is boring 😒 vote glow squid I CANT BELIEVE YOU'RE SLANDERING SQUIDS 💔 Yeah but if the mob vote vid is anything to go by, then the glow squid will have a *fun* mechanic of hypnotizing you at the bottom of the deep ocean. It’s a squid reskin with emissive textures (doesn’t actually create light) that punishes you for looking at it.  its literally called a glow squid why wouldnt it glow so is the mooshroom plus glowing squid can lead to more dyed blocksGuys, nobody want glow squid, it's absolute trashWhy do people think that the flower cow and mr not even glowing squid are a good idea to add to Minecraft over a mob that fits with the mountain theme? Genuinely confuses me and people are over reacting saying its "phantom 2.0" When the phantom isn't even that bad to begin with. Vote glow squid (:Kalo pertemuan pertama terus ketemu sperm whale atau humbolt squid, berarti lagi di deep sea ill go moobloom but at least the glow squid is better than the chillager or whatever i want my game to be nice and happy and cute i dont want weird grey dickheads pushing me off a cliff Convert to glow squid. It's just a squid that grows I personally believe that this is the best option, sure we don’t know exactly what it does, but who’s to say it won’t be the best one? The iceologer just seems annoying(if they implement it like a normal hostile mob) and the moobloom just seems like nothing unique. Glow Squid ftw the cow and the squid are my favorite but.. cow,,I swear to god if you guys don't vote for glow squid I don’t have enough information to vote yet. But Iceologer is definitely pretty cool (pun intended). The cow is just a companion for bees and the squid might have cool features they didn’t tell us, but we don’t know. I don’t think you know but the glow squid basically functions like an endermans eyes. They don’t produce light, all they do is have an emissive texture. Aka it’s another squid that will hold no purpose squids die on shore which is a useless light source plus all they do is glow and thats all its adding nithing to the game The Glow Squid is literally a squid with a different texture. The Iceologer has an incredible attack and is a really interesting challenge! The Glow Squid is literally just a squid I would have genuinely loved the squid in the update but it just seems so.. useless. I really want more larger mobs in the water environment but this one really doesn't serve a purpose. VOTE MOOBLOOM EVERYONE Mh need a bit of help deciding Does killing a glow squid will drop a glow-ing dye... or the usual Black dye? that will surely help me decide :DIf you vote for glow squid you're memeing Moobloom: Nature Cow Vibes Chillager: another enemy with more confusing attacks that will be in at least 200 kids nightmares Glow Squid: IT GLOWS. JORDAN IT GLOWS. COME ON, THIS THING GLOWS MAN. IT GLOWS! squid doesn't even provide ambient lighting and the moobloom is useless. Vote Iceologer Idk why but i feel like glow squids will drop something that make it so you can make coloured light sources squid I vote for the Glow squid ! Cause squid glow Oooooomami you reaaaaady to screaaaaam Everyone has to donate a nominal amount - perhaps one squidAún no me he quejado de la votación de mobs de esta Mineco.... -craft Live. Son super cutres pero voy a advertir: - Sólo se vota el mob y nada más. No, ni os van a dar las orejeras, ni el snorkel, ni aletas... y aún menos el submarino. - El Glow Squid no va a dar luz de bloque. Because squids are useless Based on the video it appeared that it would emit light level. Honestly at this point I’m not excited about any of the new options because I think they all don’t offer much. The squid probably offers the least though. Does the Glow Squid emit light? 🤔 Moobloom is currently winning with 31k likes while the glowing squid has 7.1k and the iceologist has 21k likes. The last thing I want is another villager based magic user that I'm only going to encounter once in a playthrough because I don't live near a mountain biome. I hope the glow squid will add some bioluminescent die or something and also it looks better than all the other ones GLOWSQUID I EMAN GL WOSUQID NO I ODN NOT ENDORSE BLOWING SQUIDS Team glow squid たすけて I'm voting for glow squid either way to be honest, but maybe I got hypnotized by a glow squid like a few months ago so I may be biased. Yeah people are especially hostile this time around. I got blocked by two guys yesterday for pointing out that the videos aren’t exactly what we’re getting, and it’s stated that the Squids won’t emit light. Same guy that blocked me is now telling people squids don’t emit light 🤦‍♂️ Ikr! The glow squid only hangs out in dark sea areas, while the chillager has a change of spawning in mountains. So the glow squid would probably be forgotten faster than chillager There are more opportunities to sell our shellfish around theAnglosphere - Australia, New Zealand Canada will pay much more for our lobsters, squid and winkles! The glow squid has this affect where it wont let you swim when you go near it, so if you run out of breath you cant go up to the surface, making it annoying to explore the ocean Question... will the squid glow? AND A FUCKING SQUID THAT GLOWS IS!?!? fuck outta here man If u want to see the Moobloom or Glowing Squid go and play Minecraft Earth. It had to be said and it was said!!! 😉👍I want the glow squid to win. I don’t want another evil villager clone. Squid fot the win LOL the glow squid can hyptonize you glow squid is just taking the squid, ctrl-c, ctrl-v and changing the texture But Glow Squids would look much better!! Plus, they'll be able to hypnotize you! Iceologer is cool for sure, but glow squid r kind of more unique for minecraft system I think. nah i dont feel like it squids are insanely useless Dm mawon mass fingers crossedWhy do people actually want the glow squid nobody likes squids anyways MEAT ZANDER they give meat and leather how does the squid give anything USEFUL? answer that before you say "aUgh thEY aLrEaDy hAvE cOwS" just answer the question cause rn it seems like you can't Same could be said for the Glow Squid and Moobloom. Glow squid when isn't racism racism? Glow Squid is a gamble I am willing to take. Would you rather have a flower cow in a place where there’s flowers everywhere or a cool squid Glow Squid!! You seriously won't regret it!! They'll add so much scenery and would make a great addition in maps!! It is literally a different skin for squid But glow squid we don’t need more illagers in the game nor any more cows. The squids haven’t received an update ever since they’ve been introduced. What would the glow squid drop? Would it drop glowing ink sacs so we can make our leather armour glow? You are saying wrong If Glow Squid would be added it would only glow and nothing else but mountain update is coming so needs iceologer for more challenge Glow squid would be same story as Phantom You can convert that into a Bone Meal farm with a Composter, but it'd be inefficient and redundant. And Glow Squids are just glowing Squids. They might have more under the hood, but they give us no information on the mob's mechanics, and I don't want to vote based on maybes. Glow Squid!! You won't regret it!Squidward is actually not a squid. He's an octopus. Akane told me and that sounds like super important info.Feliz dia da luz, trailer da Glow Squid revelado, ilha das luzes no My Singing Monsters, o que mais falta? 🏝️✨🦑im getting way too emotional ont this squid thingSo the glow squid does what? Can he be used to pacify hostile mobs? That's kind of how I took it. THE SQUID IS A MOB! The squid can’t be used as a light source, as it itself glows. It doesn’t light up the area, it just glows. And the glow squid is just as much as a reskin as the chillager so that point doesn’t make any sense don't mind me just going over and calling the young black man down the street the n word cause it's fine! it's just a joke! "another" THERES ONLY ONE SQUID This is exactly what we need! I would vote for the Iceologer if what you are saying was confirmed, but it is not. And as I judge the options by what we do know, not by what it could be, from my point of view the squid would make a nice aesthetic addition and a (somewhat) useful one.I hope the Glow Squid wins the Minecraft vote because its cute and unique.. Mooblooms would be real cool if you could sheer them for flowers, and as for the Iceologer I think there are enough Villager types for now.. I can guarantee that the winner will probably be the Iceologer consider: squid better Before they had dedicated videos for them I was team squid but they didn't make me want to vote for them through the video... s hut the fuck up squid glowOk I think Glow Squid would be the best one for the Mob vote 何があったん？|´-`)ﾁﾗｯ squid better Well they said that they are gonna tell more about the mobs during the live stream before we vote, I hope they add so the glow squid can drop ink that glows and that you could make glowsticks that are basically torches that work under water. Ya basically, boring misa voting for glow squid The video probably hinted at what the glow squid could do. Also, for those snowflakes out there complaining about a chillager being a phantom 2.0 just remember, the glow squid has this annoying effect when you go near it there's a effect wont let you swim, so you cant swim up to the surface when you run out of breath, which is irritating As we recently found out, it is a renewable source of flowers. Bee farms are great bevause honey has become an interesting block now commonly used in red stone. The squid will again be the first mob to emit light level, but I do hope it does more. Glow squid the best Squid The chillager is lame. New attacks are not a good thing. And having a copy of another mob isn’t a good thing either. The glow squid is a very useful mob in the building side of the game. Builders like me would use that squid in a heartbeat for many builds. Ok squid 🐙 Squids in game don’t do anything as is, making one that glows won’t change much it's a racial slur. racism exists for both sides, yes it's not systemic oppression but racism is racism. a "hurtful" joke directed at someone solely because of their race is still racism. All glory to the Glow Squid minecraft players are given a choice between 2 dumb options and 1 cool option and are like how fucking dare you present something cool to me. like the glowing squid can literally be added later anyway as can the cow i’m going bonkers I want this more then the cows and glow squid I'm definitely voting for the glow squid...So mesmerizing..... Why are people saying the glow squid will be useless? They're telling you in the video that it will have some sort of hypnosis effect which could be really cool, and probably usefull for mob farms. 未成年がお酒飲んじゃいけない法律はないですよね？法学部さん？？？ thanks for the chance 🦑 🍀 squid better 明日ゼミの発表やねん Vote the squid they dont reveal their details before releasing vote squidddddd Yeah lololol that was our practice animal and if you couldn’t handle it you couldn’t move on to the squid 🦑okay but why would ANYONE vote for the moobloom or glowsquid over the chillager? What, you think we need more cows? A squid that is functionally indistinguishable from its normal counterpart? The chillager will NOT be a phantom repeat, vote chillager  We already have three cow variants!! Plus, they won't have much use, because there are literal bee farms already. The squid will bring both the adorableness and scenery into the game for oceans!! Plus, possible fear when looking from the surface with shaders, due to the glow! UDAH IH SQUIDngl tho the cow and the squid look cool too, new passive mobs would be cool I voted for Glow Squid unintentionally  Iceologer: -Brings actual gameplay feature -Fits with the next update -Adds to the lore -Brings a new challenge to the mountains Glow Squid: -Glows -Glows -Glows -Fucking glows that's all it does you dumbass But the rest serve purposes, the squid doesn’t. The new one might but we don’t have enough information about what it does or what it drops. Stfu, we know its S U R V I V A L M O D E. We loaded the world that way, and its fun to grind and build. The iceologer just doesn't do shit. Look at the moobloom, probably has flower farm potential. Glow squids will probably make luminescent lights. What will the iceologer do? I want the light up squid huh you say somethin i've been staring at this squid for the past few hours now But they never said the glow squids would do anything either It’s just a squid that glows in water he doesn’t do anything specialso now glow squids distracts a person thats not even that cool thats literally all it does こちらこそよろしくお願いします！！ Umm... its called a "Glow Squid" Which implies that it GLOWS Glow Squid Nah glow squids. Mojang basically neglected squids. fingers crossed わたし悪くないもん WE WANT GLOW SQUID Definitely would. I do a lot of cooking. I think the glow squid could drop glow stone dust. 田町行って止まってゼミと授業出て夜帰る Are you Team Glow Squid? It does glow but like enderman eyes like if you put an enderman in the dark you will notice how his eyes glow but its eyes doesn't actually light up anything so does the glow squid let the man have his glow squid you dinkus you still havent told me how in any way shape or form that the squid is useful Dude, squid is trash, just accept it and let it goOk so people are voting on the Iceoliger and here is why you shouldn't (IMO) First -people might say it is annoying like the phantoms that we have voted Second -Vote Glowing Squid It is CUTE and SHINY Third -I JUST WANT MORE ADORABLE STUFF OK!?  No unique mobs - -Dolphin -Cod -Salmon -Tropical fish (and I mean A LOT of tropical fish) -Squid -Drowned Mountains having too many mobs- -Alpacas -Alpacas -Goats (not even yet) -Don't forget AlpacasHey , could you please provide me the glow squid texture? I will implement him into mc using a resource pack (optifine random entities, emissive texture). They would spawn in deep oceans Add minecart squid oooh mooshroom: probably just a dandelion glow squid: probably just an ink sac chillager: probably something ice or snow related (maybe a new item to do with snow/ice) unless they announce glow squid drops have something rare or new im not voting for them glow squid うるせえな、酒くらいガキでも飲むだろ 🍨 the squid glows I actually think the Glow Squid being distracting is a feature and not just a joke. Like if you were underwater and saw a glow squid, you would stop being able to move and just be focused on the glow squid. Idk, just seems like they were hinting at that. They're all reskins my guy. A bad Villager that throws Ice, a Yellow flower cow, and a glowing squid.I'M !!! They're literally amazing, and have so much potential at adding amazing sceneries! Also I'd love to see that glow under shaders, and gives Squid's their very first variant!! PLUS, They can hypnotize people underwater to kill them! Vote for them!! but squid jordon i love you and you're one of my childhood heroes but this tweet just isnt it,,,, /3 glow squid for the win Okay I'm back now in this video they give some information about the glow squid but what I cant understand is the mc community and how dumb yall are the glow squid hypnotizes you it shows right in the video tubers saying they dont understand need to get they're brain checked Glow squid is cuter thats why piss cow glow squid imo okay, so me going outside and calling the nearest black person the n word isnt racist? cracker and the n word both have the same intent, to belittle and demean based on skin color. why vote for flower cow when you can vote for squid baby glow squids? Exaxtly! Squids deserve more love!! the squid is the worst vote choice we need colored lights in the game and glow squid is a direct path to that useless since release. the squid I dunno, the cow and squid both suck ass The squid 🦑 The Glow Squid, while being a mobile light source, definitely feels like it's going to have some sort of status effect if you look at it. tell me something new to the game that the squid brings THAT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ANNOUNCED AND NOT JUST AN ASSUMPTION also yeah, like gala just said happiness SQUID moobloom: just some mooshroom rextexture glow squid: just a squid but like, enderman eye effect chillager: a new enemy with a new type of attack (ice falling from the sky onto you) Team Squid on Dangerchat feels betrayed xDSo from the Minecraft mob vote videos i would pick the Iceloger, the Moobloom was sort of interesting and Glow squid didn't seem so interesting people need to stop slinging around the word racism. it was a JOKE white people aren’t a minority aren’t discriminated against for their skin color so it’s very hard to actually be racist to them. yes you can be hurtful but a fake slur isn’t enough to be called racism Maybe I shouldn't have highlighted that much lol I was mainly pointing out how all it tells us is that it'll have an Enderman eye-like glow, but other than that it's basically just a squid HYPNO SQUIDWow he deleted the reply. Basically it said that we have too many variants of cows and villagers so vote glow squid. The article says that the Glow Squid glows like the Enderman's eyes. It never said ANYTHING about it being a mobile light source. It just glows. There's nothing more to it.Glow squid really is just a glowing squid oh my god please guys no ice guy come on glow squid is cool actually please pick the squidSquid Sisters - Tide Goes Out (Ngas Localisation) Yes please, I know just the person who would love this.  squid because yesGlow Squid distraction dance?? What?? Glow squid only glows like the enderman's eyes. It won't be a portable source of light. Squids are useless, and nobody really cares about the cuteness of mobs. Its all in the function. Iceologer is actually intresting, with his new attacks. no ❤️ i like how squids are the only mobs that intentionally kill themselves zander you can't keep acting like the squid actually brings anything more to the game than the moobloom does In Minecraft Earth, they drop the same thing as normal Squids. What is the point of going through a hassle just to get INK SACS? Glow squid is a good mob おやすみ！ Glow squid to win🏆 squid pog I always loved the Squid-head card as a kid. Was transfixed by the designthese minecraft mobs like cool honestly its between the squid and the villager squid is best I hope, you know, it's a rare squid variant, what spawns in the deep oceans and drops ink sack. Who goes to the deep oceans to get ink sack? And this squid will be RARE. And the other squd will stay in the game, so it won't be the squid what's in the game. This is bad. SPARE A THOUGHT FOR THE GLOWSQUIDS! SQUIDS ARE PEOPLE TOO!! cows already have a mushroom variation, there are different pillagers, yet there is no variation for squids, I want a new type of squid and maybe a Glow Squid colored bed, wool, or blocks that use dyes. Please everyone listen please dont vote for the cow we already have 2 different types of cows it wont even do anything and the flower biome is good enough on its own and for the squid it'll be the same just glows we already got a aquatic update unless it was a like shark then no i hope glow squid won't be stopid like real squid This ^^ I sense that the Glow Squid will just be another Polar Bear-type of mob. Its cool for a couple of weeks, but its forgotten after a while. funny haha cow cool squid or an ice man that makes building on mountains more difficult? hard pass for me Glow squid video has no new information lolI’m thinking I might vote the Glow Squid at Looks like the Glow Squid will have some sort of distraction mechanism maybe locks the camera angle? Oloko!!! Glow Squid subiu!!!  Idk. I see a lot of potential with the glow squid. Maybe colored light sources?Aku baru sudah makan Taokaenoi squid amenda ntah. Terbakor mulut so we should instead vote for the first new squid family member, and be disappointed by it's lack of features? hmm... kinda reminds me of the phantom incident wouldn't you agree? To anyone who sees this, VOTE SQUID we could maybe get a new potion that we can yeet at mobs and make them fight for us (hypno potion) and then we could hypnotize the ender dragon or something!!! Absolutely, the glow squid shines, but not as we would like, so I prefer a new hostile mob to bring life to mountains 💛 I might vote iceologer. But why does the glow squid have more votes than moobloom? The moobloom still has some use involving bees, pollination, honey, crop growth. But the glow squid? It's entirely useless!I’m super excited to play squid game again with my 52 Gal. But dang, I just wish things had a bit more impact. I’ll probably complain about it or talk about it when I stream it again. Open to thoughts and opinions but since it’s a feeling not likely to alter too much. the problem is with that tweet is that “cracker” isn’t a real slur. it may be a ‘hurtful’ joke but in no way is it a slur what the person in that tweet showed was a hurtful joke not racism. because white people don’t face discrimination for their skin color more like - squid but it stuns you - bee sexual tension - person that just wants to be left alone at the mountains The fact there's a squid that glows appeals more to me than anything else let’s vote für den glow squid I doubt the new type of them would be a better source of the items you mentioned than the existing raids or woodland mansions. At least the new squid would get more drops for sure. We want squids to swim graciously, not clunky enough to fly out of the water.. Haters will say keep it the same, but lovers need change Bruh imagine having a Squid that glows and a cow that makes flowers.... This post was made by Illager Gang! Exactly! It has a new attack, new skin and new location. It makes mountains more dangerous and it creates new experience. But from my perspective the glow squid just glows in the ocean. It doesn’t add anything new and will get boring in the first week everyone is saying that the squid hypnotizing you so you can't move is a great mechanic. Can't they see that it's the phantom all over again? I'd rather not drown in every ocean I visit. Wrong. It's glow squid zander there are like 5 different natural colors of sheep and the squid does nothing get your shit together Glow squid will just, glow. Nothing that appealing tbh I’m more of a creative builder than a survival player, and I think their is plenty of uses for a squid that glows no the mob is completely useless, its just a squid retexture. the iceologer actually has a cool ability to drop ice on the player's head as a cool and unique attack. the moobloom does literally nothing I will vote for squid only if you in words will confirm, it can hypnotise the player and has animated texture I was one of those dolphins. The captain promised us five squids each - we're still waiting. I just want to know what they actually do. Does the squid drop some sort of glow dye that can be added to terracotta or wool to give more options for lighting in builds? Does the Moobloom provide a way to farm flowers or honey? Are these just for show? Does the glow squid come with a dynamic lighting system? Like a good refactoring of lights? Colored lights? SQUID??????? And for finish the Glow Squid: - More diversity to the deep oceans biome. - New texture unaffected by ambient light. - Possible new shiny item (not light) - New ink fountain. - Shiny Texture Mods inclusion start to Deep Oceans. It's a glowing squid, would look amazing for decoratingEs mas, me voy a hacer un su de mini yo squid para que creen vínculos y así ni se te asome a la cabeza la idea de rebanarme la mía. why then would it be called a glow squid if it didn't glow they wouldn't have put it in the mob vote if it was just a squid re-skin Come on guys we have one type of squid We already have 3 cows and 6+ different illagers Awesome If you don't vote glow squid just don't even talk to me the only difference between the two is that one has a history of being used and the other has much less so. they are both used to demean/belittle based on skin color. it is still racism no matter the outcome. Not offending anyone (I'm going to), peaceful is for babies. Peaceful should have hostile mobs too but with less health and less damage. As I already said before, the m. cow and g. squid are just a retextured version. It doesn't make any sense to have this voting. anyway... The way his hair looks like it’s moving makes me 🥺 very cute Keatin is a new friend! She is a lovely Squid with a alarming talent in the area of Writing Music. Normal Squids will probably take the most of the Squid Mob Cap if you travel the seas like that COOL SQUID No, your punctuation is horrible, don’t blame others. GOD i hope the squid wins if u dont vote squid u have no taste/j え待ってラララライ体操知らないんだけど DONE SQUIDAfter the reveal trailer for the Glow Squid, I'm not too sure about voting it anymore. Does it distract your character and act like an RLCraft siren? I don't need another thing in the ocean to terrify me. (Ocean Monuments terrify me.)  I really love the Moobloom but I ALSO REALLY WANT A SQUID UPGRADE 🥺 Fishes spawn much more oftenly than Squids in the game, so first you would have to go deep to them spawn or go for a biome were fishes don't spawn that oftenly Thought you meant right as in agreeing with the comment, relax. My boy glow squid 🦑 look me in the eyes and tell me the squid doesnt look badaws So guys in the 2020 i will vote for Iceologer, but in the same thing i want to vote for Glow Squid, but ok, i will vote for Glow Squid. The Iceoger would be a cool Monster but he would feel a bit out of place, The glow squid would be good for building but it seems eh The moobloom is a beautiful mob and we get the third cow species Im voting moobloom I’d assume the glow squid drops glowing ink, used to make glowing dye that can be added to leather armour and wool. This could be good for builds and just looking cool in general. My boy glow squid 🦑  すごく困ってます Vote iceologer because it can give way more opportunities to the game than a yellow cow and a glowing squid also the wither roses are the main component of most mob farms but I am just comparing glow squid's main two functions (that we know of) to the endermansmash announcement trailer. opens up with squid kid and link fighting. they get into a dispute over rules, and kirby (in a referee outfit) is asleep. But wait, a blue pant leg is seen. you hear it. "OBJECTION!" is it? yes! the original trilogy is now on sale on all pla the fucking squid Moobloom: Bee's best friend (Everybody needs a friend) Iceologer: Phantom Glowsquid: Henry Stickmin (Squid edition) I'm still voting for the Moobloom since we need a useful mob and a friend for the bees first off i never said it was okay it’s never okay to hurt somebody or insult somebody no matter what but you can’t compare being made fun of to being oppressed in today’s society being called the n word and being called a cracker will never be the same and that’s just how it is The article speaks for itself. These Glow Squids literally only exist to look cool. Honestly, I just don't see the point of adding a mob if it barely does anything. That just sounds like wasted potential if you ask me. While the Glowing Squids don't even have dynamic light and in Minecrafy Earth just drop double the amount of Ink Sacs Ahh all the mob choices are really good!! I wish we could have all three of them /3 I just saw the Iceologer preview yesterday and can’t wait for the glow squid...vote squid! DON'T VOTE FOR GLOWING SQUIDS VOTE FOR MOOBLOOM INSTEAD Ah yes, I want a piss cow that talks to bees, and a cosmetic squid that doesn't even glow Vote Glow Squid Vote glow squid, why would we need another illager, or another cow. There is one squid that for all we know could also give us another potion, a hypno potion. The vote happens in 2 stages, first all 3 then the wining 2. Vote your favorite mob but if it loses... 🦑 If mooblooms aren’t winning, then I hope glow squid does what does the glow squid even do? “The glow squid has no purpose” but it’s cute 🥺 Except it doesn't do the same thing as pillagers and villagers it adds more challenge to the gameplay rather than seeing a glowing squid just swimming in the water... How do you know? Also I said that they wound immediately regret the squid I’m saying they can, they can for all the mobs Vote for iceologer, cow is meh and as a sky army recruit squids are the enemy (cant bielieve im trying to revive this) This is a great conversation and all but I think glow squid is going to take it. Stealing from Matt Taibbi:The world’s most powerful retailer is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. we don't need a shitty squid that does nothing? at least the cow gives meat? why aren't you mad about pink sheep then? they are the same as normal sheep, they don't spawn a lot they do nothing but you aren't fighting to abolish pink sheep i prefer another illager more than a reskin that does nothing, and drops the same as normal squids I’m doing the glow squid so that we can get submarines Snowier snow and glowier squid. I’m still waiting for that mountain update so I can have snowier snow and now I gotta wait for the mob update for glowier squidI'm so ready for the minecraft livestream. HYPNO SQUID FTW!! Moobloom is also cute. this is the most fucking squid Well we for sure don’t need an useless mob like the glowing squid BUT THE COWWWWW. jk you're right, my friends are begging me to vote for the cow but just imagine swimming down deep and seeing the lights of the squid. Also think I all the things you can do with it decoration wise!Susah banget dapetin fb base squid, ingin cry Glow Squids will deeply in the ocean, which is not something that people do that much A FUCKINFDN SQUID gay hypno squid And you hardly see the squid now ikr, why tf do people want the glow squid? The people who vote for this dumb squid are the same people who die most of the time by drowning.All the teasers are in! Now what mob will you be voting for? Will you become attached to the Mooblooms like the bees, maybe you'll be want to get into snow errgh hail fights with the Iceologer, or will you get hypnotized by the Glow Squid?  I... Will.... Vote..... Glow... Squid..... maybe the glow squid can drop something that would all to make glowing potions in survival? Also people can regret the Squid, if it does nothing new to the game people will either think A: wow we added a mob that can’t do anything new or B: they will literally forget about it. cow is dead in the water already. glow squid has a chance bc it could give you some sort of status effect that blocks your screen with would be sick, we have to wait until the stream to tell. it's looking good for the iceologer. The glow squid should drop an item used to craft coloured redstone lamps I voted for the Glow squid coz it looks cool! 😊 But the pretty glowing squid retexture is very interesting. We got the Mooshroom as well, so I'm going for the squid GLOW SQUID FOR LIFE!!!!! Seriously, why are people wanting this? Its just a squid with a brighter texture, they even show it doesn’t give off any light here. Basically it's turned out to be a damp squid ありー😘 New objective: view the Glow Squid... Take a closer look... Swim closer now... Swim closer now... Ignore the fact you are out of oxygen... Swim closer now... The way they portray it, it’s like the Mesmer from Subnautica Glow squid thoughmoobloom voters, glow squid voters, I think we can all agree that Iceologer voters are the worstGlow Squid Bois let's do this In Minecraft Earth, they literally drop the same things as normal Squids do. The theories about Glow Squids dropping "Glowing dye" probably won't come true at all.im with the squids Maybe the squid can drop a new type of light source called glowfluid and it can be crafted to make glowsticks🤔But he's popular with the squid kids, so I guess that makes him hip. 3 cows isn't a lot and squids are boring and don't need attention, there's a reason why they don't get it What do you want? An useless floating squid, a cow with flowers or a new hostile mob with new features crazy infos: the glow squid is glowing I saw a theory on reddit. It was like: Glow dye maybe? Glow armor? Since then I wanted the squid so badly! :D Glow squid. It sounds cool. I care about squids 🦑 The squid I'm with the Iceologer. with it you get a brand new enemy in the game with a brand new way of attacking. The Glow Squid is literally only a reskin, it does nothing new it drops nothing new. The Moobloom is just a cow that lures bees to it. The Iceologer adds the most to the game. Glow squid looks the coolest imo the squid I think they should have made glow squids drop glow sacks or something, so you could make some new ocean lamp stfu i'm voting glow squidNot gonna lie, glow squid seems lame as heck It's just a retexture, just get a texture pack that makes the squid "glow" Just saw the Squid video. yup the mob is evil nvm i'm voting glow squid lmao I’ll vote this for sure. What I’d like: Not only one glowing squid color. It applies on players and mobs the admiration effect. So thet will follow it like they are in love with it. You can pet this mob so it glows your way through the darkest places of the ocean. Doesn't look too good for this one so far. If it's just a squid reskin, definitely going Iceologer. If it hypnotizes you or blocks your screen until you get away, then I'm voting this since it'll give us the ocean danger I wanted from the first mob vote ANOTHER FUCKING SQUID BUT LOOK. IT GLOWS Squid would prob drop prismarine if you kill them and? your point is? no matter the outcome it is still classified as racism and not okay no matter who is doing it to who. shouldn't happen period. can't believe people like you are actually defending any sort of racism, even towards white people. Why vote a re-skin squid? Go for the Iceologer I love the Glow Squidi hope glowsquid wins LIKE LOOK AT THAT FUNKY SQUID LAD!!!!!!! WHO WOULDN'T WANT GLOWY BOY IN UR SEAS??? 後はマルチ出来るのがダンジョンだけっぽいのよねー ダンジョン周回してガチャ回す楽しみ的な感になりそうではあるSquid Squad - Ink or Sink (Pasto Localisation) probably gonna vote for the cow or squid I think glow squid is my choice. Mooblooms seem entirely useless and I think there's already enough pillagers. The glow squid would might also be useless but we already have a cow variant. Sometimes I don't know if I'd like him to be my partner or my father :'3 Not both tho x'D glow squid gang the submarine comes with the squid? The squid - it never had any magical powers in minecraft earth - you're not talking about the submarine, the scuba dive gears but you keep arguing that the main focus is the squid so everything about it is real, isn't that clearly bias? No, the new cow and squid will do nothing to add to the game. They will be cool to look at for awhile when they first come out and then every will realize they are boring while the illager adds new mechanics like new attacks and makes the game more difficult.Please vote moobloom. I don’t want the iceologer we already have strays for snow biomes 😔 Glow squid is alright ig There are rat traps in my basement. On four occasions they've caught a rat. They have never caught a squid. What are the odds?!? The squid is a boring mob that just goes when it touches land. And how many times when YOU play minecraft do uou say: hey a squid! I wanted to see that today. I prefer Iceologer most but only imagine seeing a Squid fishy boi in the ocean This vote is really dividing the community I think. The builders want the glow squid, the fighters want the chillager, and the survivalists want the moobloom. Whoever wins declares the largest group of Minecraft players. This vote is definitely not the best. I'm voting Moobloom, personally all of these mobs seem really boring to me. (Mooshroom, but flowers. Evoker, but ice. Squid, but it glows and doesn't act as a light source) I think Moobloom could be helpful for flower and bee farms. So for now it's Moobloom. Yeah lmao. The glow squid sounds cool. I only want iceologer because if they drop ice it would make a easy auto ice-farm. They would probably mention that if it was a feature. It’s most likely just a way to emphasize how pretty the glow squid is, and that it’s main purpose is adding to the atmosphere. the squids are glowier than before wait so is this squid literally just for looks only? bruh even the flower cow has more usage than this"glow" squidだった She touches his heart, both literally metaphorically, I'm melting, just the way he looks at her ;_; I doubt they will give Glow Squids the ability to hypnotize players. It would be really annoying to travel in deep oceans and be hypnotized every few seconds. I just don't see it happening at all. and iceologers can be used to populate builds. glow squids will do nothing except swim and maybe die to guardians. plus it doesn't matter which one wins because they'll likely be forgotten like the week after they're released No one cares about squids that’s why they don’t have variants To be honest, I think this year's mobs are kind garbage... Two of them just decorate the game, and the third one is another illager version. I'd kinda like to vote for the old ones again, wich seemed more interesting, instead of a yellow cow, a squid and a ice illager- You can't be serious, Glow squids can't hypnotize people, it was just a comedic exaggeration of how players look at their glow. Iceologer is highest but I bet later we will see Glow Squid higher I want the squid too, but lets be real, sadly people are gonna vote for the iceologer like they did with the phantom :/ iceologer or glowy squid Haha, I can 't promise all the squids I'm afraid but if you want to DM over your email address I can take a look at the claim for you 😀 -Joe 2連休で行くには遠い Exactly, that’s why I want the glow squid in the game. That's coming in 1.17 though. But the code for the squid and mooshroom is already there, and the texture for all the mobs. the only thing that will require any work is the iceologer Why? Because so far, all the Moobloom does is interact with bees which is useless if you have flowers, and the Glow Squid isn't even a real light source and glowing neon blocks were not confirmed. Iceologer adds a REAL challenge if you so choose to reach the peaks.if glow squid wins, ill be kinda happy, if iceloger wins ill be happy, and if piss cow wins, i won't be mad... ill judt be disappointed.My vote is the Moobloom or Squid (But most likely Moobloom). sissy hypnosis squid Ok, lets suppose that the squid on rtx/shaders is beautiful, what about the majority of the players that cant even play with shaders? Thats an really bad reason, we are talking about the main game not addons or mods Yes but like, imagine lighting up your base, with a fricking squid this is the place, EVERYONE bind together for the squid to get a fixed AI, so they stop BEACHING THEMSELVES. Cephalopods are our FRIENDS!!!Third Vote Option: Glow Squid: This mysterious wonder lives at the dark depths of the ocean. Pros: It will have a signature glowing animation. May hypnotize players in some way. They could add new coral alongside this. Cons: It’s similar to the squid. It will be hard to find. Kill the stimulus bill, trumps biggest trump card is stock mkt. Tell Pelosi to stop the stimulus and let mkts go down until elections. Biden loses if mkts are up. Do not trust Munchin he is a squid. my wishes and ideas for the glow squid because I would appreciate it and it can hopefully be heard!they didnt even explain what the squid will bring is it like a siren and you get distracted by it?but i dont play minecraft sooooooo all i am saying is glow squid or the moobloom Squid bad. Squid do nothing. Squid go die on land. No vote squid😡🤡🦑 yeah but glow squids would stay out of your way and they might actually drop something too they could maybe be a source of glowstone in the overword which would be neat By the way it looked, it looks like it could hypnotize people. Have you noticed that each of these mobs seem to have its own special feature? Moobloom attract bees. Chillagers throw ice. Glow squids “hypnotize”. If so, that would be crazy. The glow squid is crap, it doesn’t even technically glow Shields can easily block the trident, And if the glow squid gets added then it's not supposed to be "fun" It's supposed to make it harder to loot ocean stuff. Squids are seen to give you a potion of vision because they have lenses that appear in the sea Glow squid doesn’t emit light unfortunately :/Minecraft glow squid 🥺 Villagers serve a purpose, cows are just another food source, illagers are really cool spins on villagers, and no one cares about the squid until now. Squids serve no purpose other than giving black ink to make dye. glow squid tho What? How would any of the monsters be useful? We have effective dye farms so there’s no point in any mechanic that the glow squid and moobloom give. And it ultimately comes down to new mechanics that are cool. And summoning ice blocks above you IMO is cool. Squid die on their own, Another squid that will do the same. Like what? attack you? that the benefit? oh wow you get to get hurt once then kill them with you netherite sword. No value late game. Glow squids could be used to make vibrant aquariums late game Vote for the Glow Squid to make the oceans more vibrant! 🦑 glow squid gang Still voting for the ice illager I think the glow squid is boring An Ink sack but it also has a chance of dropping a new item/material because of its glowing? I can't wait to learn more! Maybe when it inks it's slightly glowing and we can bottle it up? Maybe we can bottle ink up from normal squids and glowing ink from the glowsquid? One more reason: a bioluminescent squid is also an actual, real life thing. If The glowing squid glows and not glows and glows again it'll be useful for a dance floor Glowing squid im gonna vote iceologer and Glow squidok but SQUID INK RICE IS FUCKING DELICIOUS ずっと待っていました… 腰がヤバいですが元気です！！！！！← why not Squid Pro MEN Glow Squid Gang. What does it doooo?! Does it trap us in a hypnosis? Do we need a material or potion/enchantment for it to not hypnotize us? Or is it a normal squid that glows and if we kill it we get a glowing ink sack that is an awesome glass texture/pattern? Or maybe if you kill it it drops And what do you think the cow does yes nothing exept for look nice and same goes for the squid unlike the Chillager  間違えました！ prince on a starでしたw because, unlike squids, illagers do things I guess your right these mobs aren’t the best a glow squid and a flower cow ice mob it is for me Thanks poke! Same goes 2 u! And ur like, so fresh that they had to add more freshness levels to even fathom ur fresh vibes, all the squid kids in the square wish they were u cuz ur so cool. Ur more fresh than the squid sisters and off the hook put together 😎. Ilyt !!!!!i think im gonna start siding w squid when they just start pulling bullshit It's so close between glow squid and iceologerI swear it's like they want us to vote Iceologer, it's literally the only mob that we've been told what it does. Moobloom and Glow Squid just sort of exist This is fucking lame ass mob retextured squid Yep, I cant even trust myself! XDDDTHE SQUID CAN HYPNOTIZE YOU?! :000 We have many variants of villagers because they offer the most variation in what you can do with them. Sadly this squid isn't different enough to warrant it being a good feature. Glow squids may not be the first light source mob, but they WOULD be the first mob with an animated texture if this vid and MC Earth is anything to go by. Do you see the glow squid glow Glowing a glow of glowy squids It is the glowing of a glow squid who will not glow squid glow squid When the glowing of your squid Matches the glowing of your squid There is a squid about to glow when Minecon comes  (きゃす、たのしみ) Glow squid gang 100% muscle increase dumb squid is dumb squid Glow squids just a squid. Glow Squid Gang. I will disagree with respect and say that adding chillagers means: -Fun Features for people who likes to make custom dungeons: *cough cough Tango -If builders actually use the squids in builds the visitors might get an hypotic effect which can sorta annoy certain people And the squid needs a new friend. This is the reason why we should vote for this glow squid. In 2017 there was a different type of squid but we did vote for it and we didn't even know it was supposed to be a aquatic update that time and I think the squid could make it up for it. YO THAT SOUNDS SICK OK NO MORE GLOWING SQUID AS COOL AS THE SQUID LOOKS MOBS THAT ACTUALLY DO STUFF ARE LOVED BY ME squid is not a source of light, it will shine like the eyes of an enderman LES go, I might actually vote for glow squidif you're voting for the glow squid, I hate you and you're stupid What do you mean “another” squid clone. There is only one squid! That the whole reason people want the Glow squid! There rae like 15 illiger/pilliger variants. Why do we need one more? Are they on a just them trip It would be good if the squid can hypnotize you while you run out of bubblesGuys do you lot really want a retextured squid or cow in Minecraft If Not vote On Saturday To make the cold biomes more exciting FTW hey squid? Squid 2 at least Iceologer has a functionality the glow squid doesn't do anything and they exist just to exist like what ur gonna do also, they don't glow like a light they glow like the endermans eyes I wish glow squid is useful like... Glow squid gives night vision when their black smoke comes out and also it blinds the players when they look at them I'm very split between Iceologer and Glow Squid and am currently slightly leaning towards Iceologer....but....glow squids are pretty....we gotta vote 4 glow squid its the only one where jens and agnes could agree It’s about time we added another squid type. It is a glowing squid glowing squids? really?... Well, it looks like you were right. The Glow Squid's introduction video seemed to show that the goggles were just part of the underwater theme, only appearing to glow as they reflected the mob's light. :/ I think glow squids should come in different sizes, that'll be cool. imagine for example these squids if they got in a certain range of you theyd like force u to look at them or something?? doesn't sound bad, but put it next to a drown fight or a guardian fight 💀 Its either that or a squid clone thst only spawns in oceans or a cow clone that only spawns in flower forests Team squid Ah yes, I want another squid clone that only spawns in one biome. Isn’t even that interesting Wait so the glow squid can hypnotize you? The Glow Squid is literally giving them effect particles. This would be really awesome for traps!  Glowsquid: Looks cool as shit New mob to the deep ocean, wich currently has no new unique mobs Possibly can hypnotize the player Has a fuck ton of potential for glowing lighting or underwater lighting Squid variant, something that isn't in the game not a farm animal or humanoidGlow...Squid... So so cute ^^ I wonder if you can make a new light source with the glow squids drops or something Vote Glow Squid!!a new mob is going to be added in the live stream I like the moobloom and the glow squid, but not the iceolager. I think a new cow would be cool and could add a new food source too, and the glow squid could add much needed light to the ocean, what do you think? Yeah and the glow squid can be used the make really cool aquariums late game. The iceologer is just another hostile illiger. This is by far the most useful mob the iceologer would be a new phantom while the glow squid can be used to make protection systens against other mobs even if they dont emite light they would still be the most usefulMy reasons for voting Glow Squid: 1. I love pretty environmental Mobs, regardless of use. 2. We don’t currently have any other Squid variants, but we have many Cow Illager variants. 3. Squids are available in all difficulties whereas the Iceologer cannot be found in Peaceful.As of right now, all of thr new minecraft mobs have been revealed and shown off. The moobloom, the iceologer and the glow squid. I'll be doing my own (SEPARATE AND NOT AFFILIATED WITH MOJANG) poll. Who do you want? (I AM NOT ASSOCIATED OR CONNECTED WITH MOJANG) i like the simplicity of it, it's just a squid that glows Squid warsparace que nos vamos a quedar congelados al ver el glow squid When glowsquids are different from other squids, iceologers are different from other illagers It adds challenge it will likely drop good loot. And mountains aren't terribly uncommon. Meanwhile the squids only pro is it looks "cool"I'm voting for the minecraft illager in the minecraft live, this question is just do you want something you can keep as a pet, something to make minecraft have a little bit more stuff going on, or want a squid that glows that you cant do shit with But I still need to know about jebs board gam.......... look how much the squid glows ah yes let’s have a glowing squid that has no use other than to look cool "The glow in Glow Squid doesn’t come from a bomb skin care routine but actually refers to the way it literally glows, in the same way that the Enderman’s eyes do." it glows but it doesnt emit any light its like a fluorescent glow True. I think I'm gonna do moobloom because even if the squid is gorgeous I really like the cute aesthetic flower cow brings more of.What if glowy squids could be used to make an underwater torch? I feel like that would be stupidly useful for underwater lighting, unlike sea lanterns which are large, and sea pickles that are very faint.  look like squid wars.... And giant squid hunter!😂😂😂 "The glow in Glow Squid doesn’t come from a bomb skin care routine but actually refers to the way it literally glows, in the same way that the Enderman’s eyes do." Its on the official description for the mob you dummie Oh so it is basically just a retextured squid. Thats why you didnt mention features. Im voting  The Glow Squid as I expected, does next to nothing except for looking cool. Sorry, the Chillager still gets my vote. The moobloom is just a cow with flowers The glow squid is just a squid that glows Both seem like reskins that add nothing to the game, but the Iceologer will add new mechanics and won't be annoying like phantoms because if u don't like them you can just avoid them Like I said if glow squid wins I will do 100 days minecraft Glow squid all the wayやっぱり、自分は「Glow Squid」に投票するかな 「動く光源」って今までゲーム内に無かった気がするから色んなところに使えるかもしれないと思うし.... 海の光源って欲しくないですか？？？() The glow squid is the mob that I consider to be the closest to “just a retexture.” No new mechanics or behaviors hinted at. The only difference from the normal squid (so far) is that it looks different. Interesting, is this to imply the Glowsquid may have some special hypnotic property? I don’t see it standing much of a chance in the vote if it’s just Squid 2. nah nah glow squid is where its at Look At Funny Squid. I don't understand why people would vote glow squid, it's a reskinned squid that glows... Utterly pointless. The moobloom or iceologer have actual uses. The glow squid is just a squid that glows and the iceologer is another illager with a new attack and actually adds to the theme of the update I’m voting glow squidMake sure you vote, everyone. Vote for glow squid during Minecraft live, and remember, politics are gay. glow squid pogI realised something about the glow squid; considering Blue light having been added and the rumours of a vanilla RTX... We could be finally getting Ambient Lighting.  そこそこ楽しいぞー ただしマルチやるまでにレベル上げっぽい事で数日掛かるようだ so the funny glow squid distracts you? I'll vote for either the moobloom or the glow squid. The iceologer is cool too, but THE MOOBLOOM AND GLOW SQUID I– I NEED THEM IN MY LIFE The glow squid IS NOT a mobile light source. It glows like the Enderman's eyes. Do people not get this? Glow squid just glows If we get submarines I will vote glow squid lolGlow Squid!  Yes add the 3rd cow and not for the 2nd squid wow Vote for a redisgned already there mob and not for the only mob that can light up the ocean Vote glow squid anyway may drop glowy ink What if they end up making glow armor that you craft using glow shards which come from glow squids, that sounds like a good update to me  If you see someone saying that the glowing squid will be a mobile light source, it's fake. Mojang devs said a time ago that this feature would require to do some relevant changes on the light system of the game, so they won't do that. It is a different squid, plus squids are pretty uncommon and boring, but the glow squid makes them interesting. The iceologer is just another illiger Glow squid more like 🤮 Sick squid, though. Moobloom is cool too, but I choose squid. Glow in the dark is what I absolutely love! got a bit of a dilemma. If I can't have all the squids.......all I want is my £98 claim from December'19 to confirm. This allows me to buy a gin advent for this year - via Quidco of course 😉glow squid 🦑🔦 Glow Squid FTW ! Stop going for the new illiger it will ruin the game vote for squid Vote closed, I need that squid for my underwater base And the other two are because. . . The Moobloom and Glow Squid do literally nothing, at least the Iceologer has a purpose. But here's a question What if the glowy squid Drops glowy ink people will be so disappointed if all you did is a reskine also we want mob ACD vote again the are 100 time better that a flowy cow or a glowy squid The ice thing is cool Fine ig i vote glow squid Flow squid What if the Glow Squid causes a sort of hypnotizing affect like this video shows? Like, it makes your vision focus on it and makes it hard to turn away? Read the glow squid page it's still a reskinned squid with a light overlay texture and how does that even make it unique? Wait, is this a bit or does the squid actually inflict an affect on players who veiw it?So eu q gostei da Glow Squid do Minecraft? Just a reminder the glow squid is not a light source. Tbh I am voting for the Iceologer. The glowing squid can hypnotize(? 明らかな違法譜面だ… past updates have added so many villager and pillager types, we don't need another one, glow squid gang rise up😈‼️ The moobloom os a clone of mooshroom. The Glow squid os a clone of squid Iceologer is undoubtedly the most different, and the coolest too! If the squid fails I’m going plan b moobloom I respect yall , but can we talk about how a bloody squid can hypnotise players like the sirens from rlcraft ?? I’m voting Iceologer, but the glow squid may hypnotize I guess, maybe like the hypno mob in subnautica, it hypnotizes you, then you swim closer and then it attacks Glow Squid! Glow Squid! Glow Squid! It doesn't give dynamic lightinge torches do The squid will glow like the endermen n spider eyes They don't emmit real light into anything nearby The squids don't have a family meanwhile the illagers have a lot of members, obviously counting the villagers golden cow random ice dude who is probably annoying squid thats useless GLOW SQUID SUPREMACY GLOW SQUID SUPREMACY GLOW SQUID SUPREMACY GLOW SQUID SUPREMACY GLOW SQUID SUPREMACY GLOW SQUID SUPREMACY!!!!! キャーーーーーーーー！！！！ いかしゃんありがとう🦑💃🦑💃🦑💃 こちらこそこんな私と仲良くしてくれて嬉しいです…🦑💃これからも公安がんばりまする！！ え、ぜひテルテルしたい🤩 最高の一年にしますありがとうございます！❤️ Glow Squid all the way. Would rather have a weird looking, glowing sea creature than another stupid Illiger or a mooshroom with flowers匠式超硬質ブロックの挙動を応用して1.12.2以下ならglowing squid の存在座標にある水を光源化できるのでは……?! I can imagine someone recreating the glow squid scene from sing. BUT ITS JUST A GLOWING SQUID Mooblooms and Glow Squids don't seem to do anything, Iceologers are the only ones that actually have a purpose.If you don't want the glow squid in minecraft then we can't be friends haha funny squid go glowwwww The glow squid won’t be a light source and won’t light up Struggling between the Chilliger and The Glow Squid A strong case needs to be made for the Glow Squid. I am not seeing why anyone would want it. Unless you tell me we can create invisible light sources or some new mechanic that drastically changes building that uses resources from the squid, i am not interested. So glow squid will have hypnotic properties? Glow squid 2020 🥺🥺🥺 normal squids have been useless forever what would a new squid provide other than another neutral mob that just exist and glows Glow Squid!! I mean they couldn't have said it any better, the glow squid is distracting us from the better option... I was holding out hope that there would be so actual content within the glow squid, but the videos entire point was, “oooo shiny shiny”. Vote glow squid Friendly reminder that the glow squid does not emit light. It doesn’t work as a light source. So it's a squid. . . But. . . But it glows. . . Vote Iceologer if you want the new mob to actually do something.  could the glow squid be a hostel mob. forces you closer to it with it glow then attacks you. I still aint convinced minecraft is adding some kind of hypnotism potion effect to the glow squids yet, :) chillagers are still ma vote Vote for squid okay okay maybe ill vote for the flashing squid. i still like the moobloom though. No more illagers please. Glow squid the squid doesn't actually glow, it just has a bright texture. If you don't vote for Glow Squids I will personally consume your grandchildren. It’s just a glowing squid Yes! Glow squid for the win! Does the glow squid do anything VITE GLOW SQUID VOTE GLOW SUID VOTE GLOW SQUID Glow squid gang Glow Squid FTW!started off my day by getting squid preservative in my eye. i felt my lifespan drop a few yrs😖 except that the squid doesn't actually glow... it just has a bright texture and it spawns in the rarest ocean biome so you'll probably never see it anyways glow squid. that is all i ask for. squids need representation Don’t give up yet my squid family. 💜🦑🦑🦑🦑🦑 gosu the squid is teal!! and glows! it is cool,. Thanks for sharing our enthusiasm over Squid!

(Medyo asa tayo sa part na yun) Han Shangyan and Tong Nian forever!🥰 you dumbo glow squid only glow as much as enderman eyes and mojang confirmed they are just ATMOSPHERIC think about it iceologer can make your manhunt videos RLLY interesting vs. squid that will probably NEVER show up in your content glow squid makes for cool ocean screenshotsYOU'RE A KID NOW YOU'RE A SQUID NOW Y O U ' R E A K I D Y O U ' R E A S Q U I D Y O U ' R E A K I D Y O U ' R E A S Q U I D Y O U ' R E A K IVote Glow Squid え、だって、さっきの、ツイート、え、え、え、ん？ 🤣🤣🤣😭 octopus ki squid ni 🤭 THANK you. we have nothing in the ocean but passive fish and squids we need SOMETHIN in there 色々調べてみたけど大丈夫そうだったからやってみたSquid Sisters - Ink Me Up (Inagta Rinconada Localisation) Default Orange Woomy, Agent 3, and Pinkling.

Percaya deh. Tp aku gak mood lihatnya, yang main sama steven zhang lagi t_____t. Kalau aku lebih suka drmaa yang romance terus light kayak gogo squid! Bikin guling2 Go go squid idrc what gets picked because the squids are kind of cool and the cows are cute and the whatever illager thing would add more to the lorePenguins Are aquatic flightless birds.They move in a group.They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. They feed on krill, fish, squid.They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. I want him to do a kermit impression now I for one have a theory. Being a glowing squid, I think they'll have a unique drop that provides the way to make a pition that lights up the area, or lights up any nearby ores and chests in caves They will just turn into normal cows when sheared, yes still better than a normal cow but iceollager are the way to go for me voting yellow cow will be a wasted opportunity and those squids are just useless mobs BOT H レジェ行けたんすね！やたー！ Logic?? You told me there were no Useless mobs, I replied with bat, you said they made that 8 years ago, I said then they have had 8 years to update it, and now your are just repeating yourself. I have also said why the squid doesn’t have a function???Yokone is a funky lil squid. Look at him go. Beef sushi huh... That sounds interesting enough!! What about takoyaki though (which, as noted above, clearly is the correct answer). Has squid, but isn't too noticeable either... 🤔 there's literally like.. nothing in the ocean. just squids and fish. we Need Glow Squids. Glow squid needs to win we need another water mob other than guardians It’s newer than the other two options, one is a retxtured squid, the other is just a mooshroom with flowers, this one has new mechanics, like ice magic, and the other illiger that uses magic gives a totem of undying, which lets you cheat death, this one might have a cool item too A glow squid that does nothing and an annoying illager that might be a phantom 2.0 are winning? Giant squid Ok its pointless to reason with someone with no sense of logic. Ever since notch left, mobs have improved and had uses. The bat doesn't need an update cause it was made so long ago. So tldr, let people vote fod what they want, dont convince them that the glow squid is useless. i need a fact check on this, i do NOT believe it😡 Haha, noice hey do u plan on making a mutant version of all the mobs, or just the original plus variants? Cuz I think mutant bosses would be AWESOME or a mutant squid! Anyway great job! Can’t wait glow squid is so cutecows have mooshrooms, theres already pillagers AND illagers, theres no real counterpart to squids :-(so if dead na diay ang squid ma turn diay sya into color gray, then I wonder why color gray si squidward hahaha cuz he's dead diay 🤪🤣 Yeah!!! YES GLOW SQUID FOR THE WINNGlowing squid : sorry to say it, but the squid seems really useless, it doesn't glow like gliwstone but glows like endermen, it is beautiful, yes, but just useless, and if his drop is glow ink, we'll use it just for 2 days and forget it, exactly like coral or 1.14gonna vote either piss cow or glowing squid, what y'all voting for? Hmm I think you want a bat like useless mob *cough* glow squid *cough*Bobby's Famous Squid Thai Basil Strip Steak 🤠✨ glow squid glow squid glow squid !!!!! Ya kan mba squid lagi julid in sender true... they kinda milked the villager thing with the addition of illagers. but, the thing that sold me on the squids, is just imagine its night, you're on a boat trying to find your way home, and a bunch of luminescent squids swim by you, right under your boat... it's just cool すくいどさんだ！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！ ありがとうございます！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！Squid Squad - Kraken Up (Boma Localisation) wow this would be amazing 💕thanks for the chance 🤞🤞 xx That's what I've been saying PLS I ONCE SAW SOMEONE DOING IT WITH A KNIFE ON MY TL LIKEE THE REALLY TOOK CHOP THE SQUID TO ANOTHER LEVEL💀💀💀💀 And her nickname is squid LETS GO ありがとう！！！ im the correct bald man listen to me we need the glow squid -bad ass -glows -no squid variants (cows and illagers already have variants) -YOOOOOOOOOOOO GLOW SQUID -pairs well with the aquatic update of 2017 -LOOK AT IT I think the moobloom is the best option tbh cuz people keep saying "But the glow squid might be a moving light source!" Yeah but they will most likely spawn in deep oceans and that would be a nightmare to move in survival, and I made a whole thread on why I hate the iceologer soo yes you can hurtful towards a white person but in no way can they be oppressed when a racist act happens upon a black person they can end up dead when a ‘racist’ joke happens upon a white person we laugh and move on they don’t die for their skin color thats the difference Small squid or squid small First vote had a lizard that ate enchants, super blaze, phantom, and angry squid. I whole heartedly agree. I mean, imagine the possibilities! Ice magic wand, New flowers, New milk from the moobloom, New potion drops from the squid! Squids🐙 Be the Baddest😻I really don't see how twitter became the more popular website when it literally feels like I'm constantly in a fight with a giant squid while I'm using this site. can we just have the glow squid and the piss cow like both let there be a tie please they look like squids with sea lanterns inside them i wouldnt be suprised TBH. moobloomers stay winning what the fuck a glow squid gonna be besides glow Therein is my issue. It might be as simple as "Bees can pollinate off those cows" or "Glow Squids generate light". Which are _neat_ but on weight of complexity versus other useful mobs doesn't add much. Glow Squid GangHello everyone! As you know, today the trailer for the Glow Squid, the final mob vote option, will be dropped. This will be my final reaction short until the show, so keep checking my twitter! :D60 million squid for bog standard trio, if Michael Edwards pulls this one of he’s genuinely nothing short of a genius!  Maybe you can make a glow stick which is an infinite light source using a new drop from the squid DID WE ALL COLLECTIVELY CALL MAMMOTH SQUID SQUID *scratches head* 넹 NO!!! what if glow squid dropped a new item and it was really cool!!! also it would be rly cool in aquatic builds in like aquariums and stuff!

I remember being impressed over these small beings having such complicated insides. How is it cheating when a bot is available to anyone bro?? It boils down to what are you willing to spend to get something millions of other people want. It’s clearly not a bot , which is why you’re missing out. I know ppl who use bots who gets every sneak それが一番かわいい what glow squid thing And that’s on worrying if ur annoying 😔👍 Supply and demand bro.

Dunks are probably the most hype resell shoe out. Well some dunks players please choose glow squid please please please beep Its not cheating though . It’s guaranteeing your chance of getting a shoe you want , a shoe that millions of other people probably want too. It’s what are you willing to spend to guarantee something that 90% of the world wants? Great Omg squids are the worst... Iceolonger gives challenge!Updated unofficial data for Mob Vote (October 3rd) poll by today: Moobloom (23,64% ~ 23,6%) Iceologer (50,77% ~ 50,8%) Glow Squid (25,59% ~ 25,6%) Bad squid no use The thing is , a bot is available to the general public . That’s the people who aren’t willing to spend the money to get something that is high in demand, just like anything else in this world. いつもありがとう！ 実績頑張って取って！（宣伝が待ってる） Me están empezando a dar ganas de votar al glowing squid I do agree, though from what i can tell the glow squid doesn't even emit light, its just a squid with properties like the endermens eyes so I presume it won't drop anything cool Flower cow thing will summon flowers when walking, kinda useless ngl ありがとうございます！ そう言われるとそんな気がします…！すみません💦 よろしくお願いします😊 1 and 3 thooo 😳😳 えへへへ嬉しいです！ありがと〜\(*ˊᗜˋ*)/♡ 私も好きですよぉ(*´ ˘ `*)♡ｴﾍﾍ You and I could get a bot right now. So how is it really unfair ?Yall dont understand how much those mr SQUID videos crack me up. I havent made an official video for him in a while but he does make an appearance in my stories from time to time It seems that Glowing Squid vs Moobloom is just coolness vs cuteness thenSquid ball HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA Glow squid SQUIDIf Joe Rogan WERE to moderate a debate I would hope he would just skip all the talk and have Trump and Biden make a choice on rather they want to eat fermented squid or Madagascar cockroaches. The winner gets ,000. Las utilidades confirmadas y las potenciales del Iceologer y la Moobloom son datos,la del Glowing Squid es un relato 😎,igual todo se decidirá en dos horas con el vídeo del Glowing Squid. It’s initially the people who are willing to spend 2k on sneakers fault, not necessarily the actual business. People stop paying stupid amounts of money on a sneak. It’ll be easier to get them again I did a worm, a squid, a frog, and a pig. Lol I can still smell the formaldehyde 🥴 Squids are cool and we need more squids for the squid uprising ! OMG GOGO SQUID!!!! 💗💗💗 iceologer is cool but i feel like we already have enough illagers imo and squids dont rly get any sort of special varieties, yk? like i do think itd still be cool to add at some point but im just more interested in the squid ぴえん🐷 Glow Squid might have a cool gimmick with it's ink (we'll find out today), but knowing Mojang, it's just gonna be another Squid. . . but it glows. Iceologer wins by virtue of have an actual purpose. asgshshshsh cocok sihhhh hll di gif itu jd squid yah????🙃 When is anything with a high demand easy to get bro? Anything in this world . If it gets to a point where you are making a profit of over 1k guaranteed for one sneaker, it won’t be easy to get your hands on it bro.Glow squid is the best mob choice change my mind Im voting Glow Squid but yeah Jellyfish could've been miles better I WISH THIS WERE A REAL ANIME ;W; so many different feels when watching this.In soft bodied prey such as squid or cuttlefish. Like all marine reptiles, it had to surface regularly to breath air. (1/2) Iceologer win by FAR unless the Glow Squid has some kinda cool ink functionality. The Moobloom is completely useless, it's just another cow, and it's only functionality will be creating infinite Bone Meal farms with a Composter, but you can already do that in other, better, ways. SO IS THE SQUID ??? NO ONE WANTS A GLOWING FISH IT JUST DROPS INK ,, , , , THE COW IS ,, , FRIENDS WITH THE BEES , , , , , Cool opinion but the thing said by the glow squid can also be said to moobloom except it's a land mob. IMO glow squid even without extra features looks cool and at night you can see moving light blue squids without actually emitting light like glow in the dark which is cool. 脚コキ可能とか体が若いですねSquid Squad - Now or Never! (Amo Localisation) I just want a glowing squid!!!! Thanks for the chance to win this fantastic prize  Omg!!! Super gwapo yung guy dito.Go go squid to??

Can’t have a pushover like that squid from last night “uhhhh mr president will you please let Biden talk?”. Rogan don’t play no shit.Salted egg buttermilk squid done!moon , for B... wherever you are now, i hope you're doing well and surrounded by many happiness 💗 i still remember the song that you gave me, crush by Tessa Violet lagunya masih kudengerin sampai sekarang, i miss you and thank you for the memories! luh-ya squid! (cont..) ngl i would prefer the illager just because of minigame purposes and stuff, The cow is just gonna be a bit useless even though is cute. What perks does the Glow Squid have except for the fact that it glows? With what? The useless ink sacs that we could already get from a normal squid? Awesome yes please こう突然変異で産まれる狂気の産物に憧れちゃいますね！ Unpopular opinion, I find the glowing squid cuter than moobloom 確か最終的に10になったような… やってみたい譜面です！ Depends on what the squid is それです！ ありがとうございます😣😣 もしかして4人リグマの方が代わり映えします？😰 Especially with how these shoes are reselling now days .Glowing squid : most useless mob, it glows like endermen eyes, just a completely retexture, and if it has glowing ink, we'll use it just for a few days and completly forget it, exactly like coral, or village and pillage items You gotta do what you gotta do to make money. Scared money don’t make no money.

Unimpressed Giant Squid approves of their disappointment. あら、かわいい♡ Regarding the voting that will happen, I'm gonna guess that what will happen is that glowsquid will lose first round of voting to a majority of Chillager and second place Moobloom. However in the second round I think alot of Squid voters will go to the Moobloom 実に有意義 役１万×７万枚だから８億行くわ(´・ω・`)カリオペの曲 Dried squid As much as I appreciate your opinion, I'd still pick Glow Squid just because it looks cool. I don't care if it doesn't add any significant to the game, I just love how it looks. 小学12年生tom yum squid with tons of garlic in it for dinner , yum yum yum from Gira, she’s too tired to really do much else but keep her legs locked around the squid and enjoy the sounds of gagging and spit scrubbing along her shaft.• i like bees too but it’s just a reskin that leaves flowers in a FLOWER FOREST. glow squid 2020 Tambien soy glow squid team Garnicht.I’m like super lmao, for adventure maps it’d be so cool to have a new mob!! Moobshroom and Glow Squid would really just be nice for decor, why can’t we have all three 😭😭😭 squid すくいっど入る時はいっしょな 言葉に言い表せないぐらい好きです。 もう半永久的にファン契約します。 ですよね(´∀｀)やったーwould you guys rather have: - a really cute cow with flowers and all round good vibes - a cool looking glowing squid that is literally so pretty - cold illagerall the new mc mobs suck we have like five cows, we have way too many hostile mobs like that’s all they ever add, and the glow squid seems pretty useless. all in all mc up your goddamn game and add deer instead フォロワー伸びすぎなw 更にツイキャス。👈 目標見失った 1番れいだーにいる時が楽しくて それを目指すところも楽しかった おらはいっちぇる！ they're right though you are very talented before voting for the ice man, remember the phantom. Do we want mountains to be like going 3 nights without sleep? The glow squid will not attack you. Glow Squid 2020 So cute! X3 Each mob has something new to the game, each with new mechanics. The Iceologer gives us a magic type attack. The Moobloom would interact with bees so it can count as a new mechanic, but they also spawn in flower biomes which are mainly useless. Glow squid new mechanic is mob glow Glow squid means almost nothing for survival players We already have enough illagers and yes the moobloom would be nice squids are useless so it would be nice to have a variation and make it useful maybe. 正味れいだーが僕の中では確実に強くて楽しかった 猛者では無いが、ガンスミス前のDLよりけり少しADS速いくらいに調整するといいよ。 実は一時期DLを１日3時間トレーニングしてた。 I really haven't thought about it as much. this just appeared in my dreams like the spirit of art steve jobs haunting me 🤣 NO BADASS GLOWING SQUID I don't really see why people want the cow,, It's prob just like mooshroom, so like cute but it won't be anything "good" for the game. And honestly between the squid and the cow, the squid looks so much cooler. Prob we'll be able to find them close to the bottom of the ocean. Fab I disagree, the chillager literally summons clouds of ice, how freaking cool is that? I do agree that the squid might be cool though. 19 y/o squid man いい歳こいてぬいぐるみ買っちゃいました ﾔｯﾀｰｰｰｰ！！！！！！！！！ まじかぁ～！！！！！！！！！まだのんでなぁい な、なるほどーーー！(なにもわからないなんて言えない) toxic squids omg 😭 I like squid one そしてビーーーーール！ \o/ Stir together 11 lbs Squid with 4 1/2 tbsps haiku roll.

And it can give you more cool and special items. also, it fits the biome update We all thought cthulhu was a squid monster. We were wrong. This thread has shown me Cthulhu is actually a fucked up little gourd monster. Considering licensed video games have disappeared from existence (Scott Pilgrim vs The World for 10 straight years), I'd hazard it's safe to assume a product dependent on a license has an uncertain future at best. mealtime is funtime with squid cuisine squid é lula em ingles kkkkk, lula lula??

Spray me mama squid spray meeeee! squid yea but the glow squid drop stuff is all speculation. at least we know for a fact that the iceologer will bring something completely new to the game go go squid -ns another situation, we’ll just see it and ignore it. the glow squid at least could drop a type of ink that makes glowing wool, text on banners, etc iceologer could drop something ice related moobloom will drop... flowers moobloom is the worst option imo I mean there's already plush of the glow squid tbh go go squid, btw ini drama.

I would love to use squids as a light source. Like underwater fireflies. It would give a completely new dynamic to underwater bases and just water based light sources in general.Surely the voting question of the moment is glow squid or moobloom?  hey pal, have a peek at these! Yum, huh? Crispy cockles in batter with a chili jam. Potato bhajis (right) And crispy squid (hiding behind the chips). On the harbourside, here in Aberaeron. When you n the missus coming down? 🤘🏻😋 Congrats! The video is so good fjdhjsjfksReason I would probably go for chillager is because it fits with the theme of the update and seems to be an interesting pick for hopefull features. I understand that the glow squid could look epic, but underwater torches or something won't happen. It's just like enderman eyes. Fr. Generally useful/important work, too, even if repetitive (depends on org, ofc). アイコン見る度にブログ思い出します(*´ω｀*) Squid rings 😍😋 Minecraft: here’s a squid Us: wow that does it do what does it drop new light source Minecraft: IT GLOWS ポポポポーン♪･:*+.\(( °ω° ))/.:+ ☆ミ　feat D.T ☆ミ チャッ♪チャッ♪チャラ♪チャ♪ チャッ♪チャッ♪チャッ♪チャッ♪チャッ♪ ♪ ✌︎('ω'✌︎ ) ( ✌︎'ω')✌︎ ♪ ٩( 'ω' )و♪ フッーフー♪ 何となく作ってみました↑ ( ^ω^ )Squids are such majestic creaturesD*ck pics are gross.

Wrong because everyone misses the fact that Alex is wearing some type of goggles in the squid image within the article (even I did until someone mentioned it). Something tells me they wouldn't put that in there without hinting the squid drops something cool... そんなん絶対笑っちゃうから確かにハッピーだわwwwwSome of the other items are squid beaks and squid eye lenses, which is what you would expect to find in a bolus. YEU!!! That's not logic, the mushrooms in the mushrooms are parasites, and the flowers are not, im voting for the iceologer or the glow squidWhat if the glow squid's ink can make colored Light possible? Yeah bc I miss the homie squid toofor what the squid could do is perhaps drop enderpearls on peaceful! the blog post specifically mentions endermen, and enderpearls are impossible to get in peaceful! a glowing deep sea squid would be a great peaceful "boss fight" and would allow peaceful worlds to go to the end!alright i gotta talk about the mc mob vote n theories. ill start with glow squid, which is sounding neat and if they show what it would do could be amazing! i think best outcome for this guys features would either be a beacon like block that prevents mob spawns. my other guess..Anything BUT the iceologer. We do NOT need another hostile mob. Just PLEASE tell us what the Moobloom and the Glow Squid does because we really need some information. Also we need some more endgame loot, as after you get the Elytra you kinda conquered the world. Moobloom is WAY better than glow squid. But iceologer is def better My punctured lungs agree. I'm kinda sad I'm leaving a month of canvassing money on the table, I got like two raises in the past four weeks lol 魔獣使い兵士じゃないし最強かもしれん ありがとう chicken kidney siya pero lasang squid ng slight ハッピーおちんこって見たことないんだけど見せてくれますか？？？ どうも巨乳ちゃんですso i found out i'm only a week older than we're perfect for each other 🥺🥺🥺💛💛💛 You can’t say anything when your voting for shit squid Now that I agree with you. That is a huge part of keeping a game fun and the community engaged.... I just wish, the content we are voting on actually had more value than "Its a squid but it glows". Like come on guys, the nether update was great! Make every update like that. vinegar squid and yucky🥴 魔法少女（おっさん） tonights debate was like a giant beef jerky, garlic and squid ink burrito. You never could focus on one of the three ingredients because they kept overpowering each other, you gagged often, and it took you 1 and 1/2 hours to chew through the damn thing. thank youuu :3 THANK YOUUUU UWU thanks UwU The cow and squid is just the same but with another look wwwTFW you want to watch a scishow vid about squid skin but the first thing they show you is squid being baked.....thanks a lot. adorable squid! excellent artwork! 🦑💖💕✨ yes to squid I know exactly what that’s like. Happens to me so much Though out come was worth the gorgeous art you created 333 BRO JUST TELL EM THAT ITS YOU FROM HS AND DIDNT KNOWN THEY WERE ALSO INTO SQUID GAME HOLY No cow eye? Squid (for the whole ink thing)?That moderator had the backbone of a squid Lefty Girls 2010: "I learned my make-up technique from Drag Queens. They're so much better at make-up than me." Lefty Girls 2020: "I have committed an act of violence against the Drag community by appropriating make-up from them, even though they got it from us." 昔のまどかちゃんも好きでしたよ^ ^ I vote for moobloom but if squid wins it will be good too. But don't let iceologer win please. We don't want another annoying mob.  The rabbit and rat were HS anatomy I believe and the pig, starfish, and squid were bio I hope they restock all Splatoon 2 amiibo, and Squid sisters, and color variants yes. and a squid Congrats In the land, oh and also phantoms only spawn if your lazy (not going to bed) and iceologers only spawn in the mountains. And glow squids only spawn in deep seas(do you go in the deep seas that often??? I think not) mooblooms can interact with bees is the thing, and a chillager would just be another annoying mob, cool idea nonetheless, but they would be annoying. and glow squids are just squids with led lights glued on them People here are getting toxic saying it's phantom 2.0, how is it a phantom 2.0?? It adds a new type of magic attack and makes the game more interesting ( if your afraid of it then just turn on the peaceful mode ) and also what would glow squids do? If you spend your time living..As a semi-veteran minecraft player I always wanted to get more friendly mobs you could use in pvp battles like knights, archers, or swordsman npcs that would roam villages or biomes but nah minecraft offer us another illager mob, golden mooshroom, or a squid who ate a glowstick Personaly i vote for moobloom but if squid wins it will be fine. I just don't want another annoying mob like phantom. 🤜 🦠 El video publicado en la cuenta oficial de minecraft, la vaca actúa como en minecraft earth, por eso lo digo, eso hace creer que el glow squid también.can Mojang just give us both the Iceologoer and Bloomshrooms, i like both of them, and they both seem cool for different things leave the Squids tho, we dont even need normal squids I dont care if moobloom or squid wins. I just want iceologer to loose. Fuck the glowsquid, id bote for the moobloom before i vote the squidI'll whip you like Squid Girl Yes. And a worm. A rat, a wild cat/weasel thing that I can't remember what it was, a squid, a cow heart, and probably a few other things I can't remember. Actual building potential with a mobile (😉) light source 👀 Vote squid is big brains plays Now robot chicken would’ve been questionable 😂😂😂😂😂 or squid billies maybe No, don't vote for glowsquid, Mojang have confirmed it will not produce dynamic lighting, it will just faintly light up like a drowned's face on MC bedrock. No cool light source. Basically the exact same as a normal squid.  I’m thinking the Glow Squid mainly because I feel it could have a good concept, killing it gives you glowing ink which is used to dye leather armor in and can light up dark places without the need of a torch or glow stone Congrats!! :D are there any with squids or octopi You say there's very little life but there's already squids, turtles, dolphins, cod, salmon, drowned, guardian, elder guardian, pufferfish and 3,584 different variants of tropical fish and if were also including buildings there's ocean monuments, shipwrecks and 2 different types thanks kuya 😊 Squid ward obviously.Ok, i have work in the morning. CYA WATCHING SQUID'S STREAM IN THE MORNING. Nyonya puff itu ikan buntal iya squid gurita I want the squid, since the cow was ONLY mentioned to be yellow. No other colors :( thank youuu ^w^ THANK YOUUUU LIL BRO!! 💛💛💛Hey, and , you are going to make a vote for a new mob in Minecraft. I have a question about Glow squid. If you wish to add him, will you gonna add a "Dynamic Light" like in Optifine? If no, this mob will make no sense! Ramen is supposed to be the noodles with soup. The soup is an addition not the meal Congratulations, you two ❤️ Ghost squid squibs Creators of squid billies went to UGA! AAAA CONGRATS BIG BRO!!! 💛💛💛Squids Scars? Oh she hasn't noticed that thankfully, she's too focused on being comfy beside her favorite squid. "Hehe~ Spongebob's a pretty good cartoon. It's always nice to relax like this."

Give me back me puffle ye scoundrel squid! you’re forgetting the best out of the three... glow squid Yes I remember, I just think that a new cow or squid would be a little boring. I mainly like to speedrun so I don’t pay attention to glowing squids or flower cows. I respect your opinion but my play style is different then just looking at all the animals. Glow squid would also be greatI need soju and grilled squid....
