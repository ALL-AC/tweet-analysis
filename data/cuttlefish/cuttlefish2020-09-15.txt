It inks our faces. Toss a coin to your cuttlefish deep in the Oh Shins are very odd.  The exhibit they had at the was amazing. The cuttlefish were my favorite. Cuttlefish are one of the only species that select for guile as well as size/strength. Big males chase others away from their harem. Small males disguise themselves as female and float past the big ones to mate. Ever watched a cuttlefish? THAT is some kool shit! Probably good eating too.-A praying mantis with 3D glasses - from the lab of Jenny Read -Cuttlefish with 3D glasses - Feord et al. 2020 -A splatometer test - Kent Wildlife Trust
