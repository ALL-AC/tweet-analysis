I remember hearing something that when inklings get super old like there's some terrifying side effect that should lead to captain cuttlefish to not being able to like move let alone be alive i think they just mature like humans from that point onwards like captain cuttlefish, he looks like an old man but retains his humanoid formis capn cuttlefish gonna be dead in splatoon 3...?

I need more than Cap'n Cuttlefish to jer- I need more cool male characters i mean.. hahah... Captain cuttlefishThe game is called Splatoon 3, and the color matches Agent 3's yellow. Maybe Agent 3 will be like the Cap'n Cuttlefish of Splatoon 3. That'd be sick af i have no idea if thats what these kids are doing though cause captain cuttlefish's tentacles dont look like this?? i assumed they were dry from their environment but im not sure anymore ^^; lore-wise, when inklings turn 50, they start sun bathing and dry themselves out in order to prolong their lifespans! they stop being able to produce ink, but they get to live a heck of a long time (cap'n cuttlefish did this which is why he doesnt have ink, but also why hes 130!)
