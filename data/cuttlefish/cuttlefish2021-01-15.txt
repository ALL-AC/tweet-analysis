Bruce can't say that, he died just sitting there, in what is most people's peak health.

Grey Giant Cuttlefish 😂😂😂 Can’t photoshop that gross 😝back and chest hair on Chuck Norris while fighting Bruce Lee. don't be silly, we can't send them caviar and cuttlefish, we earned those from our hard work grifting the british taxpayer. They can have half a tin of smartprice tuna and 1/3 an onion Bruce Lee was an asshole. Perhaps. I only got to meet Bruce once, I trained under Chuck for a few years, when I was a young guy he was always kind of a dick. Never asked about his politics, but I was not at all surprised that he's right-wing. Say what you will, he was likely still is, really bad ass. YES!!!!!!!  and Bruce also kicked his ass when things got real on the movie set Bruce would be ashamed of the right wing extremist Chuck became. I doubt they'd still be friends. They were good friends, you know. Bruce wouldn't like you making a comparison. Jst sayin' Did someone forget to tell that Bruce lee is dead? Dead bodies are not superior to the living. Isaiah 45:5 By a factor of 1,000,000,000,000 (or more).  Also, he never complained about Chuck Norris being white and having white privilege. He succeeded in America as well as China(with more trouble in China) and didn't allow being held down. He never placed blame on anybody. Bruce Lee was amazing. I haven't seen a lot of his movies but the last one I watched showed how incredible he was.Cuttlefish ❤️ BRUCE LEE WHIP HIS ASS . I was about to make this post! Yet here you are Wisdom 👊🏻 Chuck Norris once visited the Virgin Islands. They are now The Islands 💯 To paraphrase Lao Tsu, “the highest good is like water”... Have you watched on ? It's INCREDIBLE! It's a show Bruce Lee wanted to make in the 70s but the studios wouldn't make a show with an Asian lead back then. He's not, he's their inspiration 💛💛 He's no or Mr. Miyagi *for points. Fighting for points. The difference is unfortunately Bruce Lee is no longer with us. Chuck is. I’m not good at spelling😂 Yes, but has he ever practiced martial arts at Marshalls? My man name the world championship that Bruce Lee won. Then, google how many had. Bruce is an icon, but Norris proved it in real life, and he greatly respects the memory of Bruce Lee, but Chuck is the one who won the fights in the ring, not so much for Bruce. Bruce lee = Actor - Chuck Norris = PKA Karate Champion for three years in a row... Declaring others as superior is never a good look and is foolish to declare.. Amen to that...

The organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.However, Pearl did not find out Marina is an Octoling until Octo Expansion, in a chat blog between her, Marina, and Cuttlefish. Having known Marina for so long, Pearl immediately decides to stick by her anyways. If any of what I'm saying interests you at all, PLAY SPLATOON! Cuttlefish smoothies? 🤔 That's some high class dining.Pearl's and Marina's affiliation to the team is unknown; however, they make contact with Cuttlefish in the Deepsea Metro before Agent 8 starts doing challenges. 3. There's also a bunch of Salmonids whose golden eggs Mr. Grizz wants, but the known details are relatively few.A couple things I forgot to mention: 1. Humans are extinct from the beginning of all this (as far as we know) 2. These "Agents" are part of the New Squidbeak Splatoon, which fights off the evil Octarians. Cuttlefish is the Captain, Callie and Marie are Agents 1 and 2.Finally above ground, Agent 8 and Cuttlefish are met by Pearl and Marina, and they're all set to go home... Until a giant human-looking head emerges from the sea. TarTar is controlling it. He was built by a human, and he was disgusted by how Inklings and Octolings turned out.The two soon meet a talking telephone named TarTar, who identifies them as Applicant 10,008. (Cuttlefish just calls them Agent 8.) He tells them of a "promised land" that can only be accessed by completing challenges across the Deepsea Metro and finding four "thangs." Cuttlefish dragon is the translation of "Zmaj od sipova" which deeptranslator gave me.Meanwhile, Agent 3 and Cap'n Cuttlefish are busy on another mission. They're attacked, and a certain Octoling is knocked unconscious. They wake up in the Deepsea Metro with no memories.

Instead, Agent 3 goes with Cap'n Cuttlefish on a mission to the Deepsea Metro, where they eventually meet up with Pearl and Marina (also pop stars) and Agent 8 (an Octoling who isn't bad) to save the world) I missed a ton of stuff but im too tired to Inkling finds some guy hiding in a sewer.
