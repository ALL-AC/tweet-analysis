Even that song has racist undertones..but Disney hid that movie for decades..but the history of splash mountain is weird. I think they put that song on VHS to get ppl used to it so there was some familiarity once the ride opened. Oh yeah. I’ve seen clips in reviews and the purely live-action scenes seem dull as dishwater. Princess and the Frog is definitely a good choice. No need to get rid of the paddleboat stuff AND there were bramble bushes used in a gag, so it fits pretty well overall.Check out what I found. Cuttlefish Bone 5 kg mixed whole amp; broken piece Birds, Tortoises 100%Natural  Yup. Honestly? I welcome the rebranding. I’ve never fully seen Song of the South and it sounds fairly dull, aside from the extremely good compositing between animation and live-action (though it wasn’t the first example or anything). Princess and the Frog needs more love anyway. I am black and went to Disney a LOT as a kid. I did not know what song of the south was until my late teens, but I always felt like the ride had some racist vibes when I was little. I instinctually knew to be skeptical when things felt old timey/pushed southern pride. It's weird because I knew of the movie and most of my black friends had heard of it but my white friends didn't. I remember having a sing a long VHS and my gram always fast forwarded thru certain things. Dumbo was also banned in my house.Spent over three hours cleaning seafood.

If they really wanna complain, Cuttlefish and Octavio are more the racists because they were war veterans who fought each other. Octavio wasn't helping by stealing the Zapfish, nor Cuttlefish taking it back. Cuttlefish learned that not all Octolings were bad thanks to Agent 8.communism but it’s actually just a bunch of philosophers and musicians and artists and writers and such all living off-grid before we devour each other like cuttlefish and realize living off-grid sucks so we come back to inhabit coffee shops and regroup to consider lighthouses..Cuttlefish.Bendandsnap Cuttlefish Cuttlefish nearly threw hands with 8 at first sight and called Marina "alright for an octoling" but Pearl's the racist one, apparently. I KNOW RIGHT! They don’t even have any evidence, they’re just using their memory of when Pearl said Octoling hairstyles were weird (which I think was before they knew they were Octolings). Or in a line with Cuttlefish in Octo Expansion. It’s all just really stupid. Can't wait till they turn Cap'n Cuttlefish into a racist /s What about the Dire Cuttlefish? there is some parallel writing with octarians being marginalized but the only character who makes any sort of comments about that is cap’n cuttlefish and DEFINITELY not pearl I HONESTLY DONT KNOW WHERE THIS CAME FROMare people seriously calling splatoon racist for Capt cuttlefish and pearl making bad remarks in relation to the octarians in octo expansion . YEA captain cuttlefish. And also theres the sexualisation of marina the whitewashing in official art merch which are like. Idk things they could actually condemn it for djdndndb this is a very little known secret but pearl keeps marina locked up in her closet when they're not performing and marina tried to send out a help message but it was found and burned by pearl and in splatoon 3 pearl sells marina to cuttlefish trust me my dad works at nintendo Cuttlefish of course Literally Cap’n Cuttlefish is like “Pearl I’m so sorry your girlfriend is an octarian :(((“ and Pearl literally does not care at allalso pearl splatoon is not racist literally if ur gonna call any Splatoon character racist it should be captain cuttlefish❤️Imagine saying pearl is racist when when she literally threatened to beat the shit out of cuttlefish for making a backhanded comment towards marina in the chat logs How is that racist? Heck, how is Cuttlefish even racist in this screenshot? Chameleons don’t change colour for camouflage. It’s more of a communication method. Cephalopods are the true masters of camouflage - octopuses and cuttlefish can change both the colour and surface texture of their skin at will.Context: they had cuttlefish in a freezer next to rabbit in the grocery store today~Bro she literally threatens harm to Cuttlefish for being old and racist I mean... it makes SENSE for Captain Cuttlefish to have a bias against Octolings in general because hes been fighting them for well over 100 years now.... but.... He shows kindness, acceptance, and even offers 8 a job. Showing a connection between Inkling-Octoling improvements I’ve seen cuttlefish bones exude more warmth! why does captain cuttlefish get a pass but pearl doesn't im in actual tears sjjddjjjsjs THATS CUTTLEFISH NOT PEARL WHAT I'd understand if they said Captain Cuttlefish was racist, 'cuz he is, but Pearl continues to support Marina even after discovering her secret. And this is purely from the "inkling-octoling" race allegory. I can guarantee skin tone is not ONCE mentioned in Pearl's dialogue. pearl threatened to kill captain cuttlefish for being racist in a chatroom “No! No, I didn’t! I didn’t even know octolings existed until captain cuttlefish knocked me out and pulled me into the valley—“ He did What.bruh.. cap'n cuttlefish is right there he has that energyOctogods above I fucking hate you so much Cuttlefish you couldn't get me a shittier aquarium could you???!!! She even says she'd like to meet more Octolings and it seems like she gets along with Marina. Not even Cuttlefish was hardcore against all Octo-kind, as it turns out, accepting Agent 8 quickly. This angle was just an easy, cheap joke to make that somehow got twisted into canon. i don't do mollusks except dried seasoned shredded cuttlefish and the occasional scallop... slimy invertebrates are not my thing. i usually don't like lobster because it's often overcooked and then it gets too bouncy/rubbery. also, blue crabs tho i hate to watch them diecuttlefish are some of the coolest creatures to ever exist The biggest question is why does cuttlefish want a happy meal I've chucked her another cuttlefish, she'll be fine now until Sunday 😉sugar red cuttlefishBut I'll be honest I was mostly adding more pictures of cuttlefish 💙💙 Of course!

Some cuttlefish males change their appearance to look like females in order to get closer to females to mate with them.before stronger males arrive.While I object to humans being compared to animals, as we are a sexually dimorphous species and our reproductive habits already understood, let’s at least use a comparison that makes sense. Margaret Atwood was onto something. Let’s stop putting cuttlefish before females. (5/5)A couple of reports have seen this behavior for different reasons. Male cuttlefish will throw on its “dress and heels” (female patterns) to get close to unsuspecting females before trying to convince her to mate.

I think this animal more closely resembles what we see with some of these men who demand we class them as women. This isn’t “gender identity” after all. It’s a mating ritual. (1/ ) But that’s a strategy to advertise fitness to potential mates; it lacks the ‘sneak’ of cuttlefish. I’ve seen one TRA evoke cuttlefish before, as a kind of natural ‘feminine’ gender role for males. They back-pedalled sharpish once the purpose of this evolved form/behaviour was spelled out. Just identifying as a cuttlefish, shoorly? どこからでも刺さってくるから！油断できないやつw 危険すぎますってwcuttlefish イカTransactivists love to compare humans to clownfish, or even slugs, when a better comparison would be cuttlefish. Weaker male cuttlefish will disguise themselves as females so they can get close to them and attempt to mate without stronger males noticing.
