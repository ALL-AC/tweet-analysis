They designed it specifically so they could sell in the US ExactlyThe Flamboyant Cuttlefish Lagoon US kinder eggs are not the same for the rest of the world. Funny...I live in the US and buy them all the time for my son  Those are specifically made for the US to circumvent the law and only became available last year. Americans still find the Kinder Surprise eggs more dangerous than guns. The US constitution would serve its citizens better if the 2nd Amendment instead read "The right to contain inedible objects within food items shall not be infringed" It is not. The real Kinder Egg is still banned in USA. These are NOT the same as real Kinder Eggs. I buy kinder surprises sometimes for meetings. The time I bought kinder joys, I was told where is the joy? The toy was already assembled. Sooo different! Especially that. Agreed It is sad that candy pedantry is where we end up when simply trying to suggest that it may be a good idea to think about how killing tools are handed to the general public. It is packed in two different chambers, I think it also contains a spoon. I'm not sure but I think it is specifically created to avoid the "ban" Kinder Eggs is suffering in the US.

These are not Kinder eggs. This is Kinder joy. It is egg shaped, but that doesn't make them Kinder eggs. That means they didn't consider Americans smart enough to realise the plastic inside the food body is not edible. Wait, don't corn dogs contain an inedible object? うっ確かに I am in hysterics!
