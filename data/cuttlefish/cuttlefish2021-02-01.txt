  No, a single drop of diluted hydrochloric acid wouldn't do much damage, maybe the equivalent of a mild sunburn. A I loved Gary Larson and Bill Watterson when I was a youngster. But my favorite was John Callahan. I like him even more, now that I'm officially disabled. His humor is dark, like, black hole dark. And deals with disability quite a bit.  In today's day of computing, in ISO C (IEC-9899) is still device dependent. I work with 16bit bytes on some (well, 2) platforms. Even a hunter as renound as Zornadz, fears the Thagomizer. Its funny because poto in spanish (In some parts of latin america) means ass I grew up on far side comics. My gawd. This is how it works?!? Poke  This is AMAZING. Amazing. Just... amazing. Would he die? No I do!! Keep em coming I still have a coffee mug with this on it given to me by my mother-in-law (RIP). Mine too. this is a happy thing Actually IEC 80000-13 formally defines a byte as 8 bits. In the early days of computing it was device dependent, but now it's a defined unit of measure. A word is more loosely defined and is archetecture dependant.I'm reading Cuttlefish's Embers Ad Infinitum and tho it's a slow start, its getting pretty good 😌 cowards Heh, I've seen that before. I really like to think of stegosaurus as a Pokemon whose signature move is the thagomizer. Came here to say this...  WAAAHHH LOL wanted to make sure you saw this I miss Gary. Homie thag... Rip to a real one I never knew this, and today my world is better thanks to this knowledge.  It's not the prophet though  yes, mentioned the Thagomizer on one of his shows, and got a grin out of me. I love this a lot! 😆 AwesomeOh goodness these creatures on the coral triangle are bonkers and amazing. What?! The cuttlefish is WALKING on the floor. And oh gosh look at the size of that female compared to the male! Oh HA HA HA he puts the sperm in her mouth 😱  A byte is officially 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 bits. 4 bits used to be called a syllable (part of a word.) A word is 8, 16, 24, 32, 36, or 64 bits. 4 bits is a quartet, 8 bits a octet, 16 bits a hextet. 16 bits is also a quibble (quadnibble) I think this would be a really murky area. Whether Larson was trying to depict the prophet, or even depict anyone specific as opposed to just drawing a guy. It’s not exactly like Charlie Hebdo. As a scientist, I can confirm that 🤷‍♀️ Larson also has an insect named after him. Two areas of science he touched on Gary Larson creating new Far Side cartoons last year for the first time in a quarter century was one of the rare good things that happened in 2020 (and that year was grim for me as it was for everyone else). It’s a depiction of Mohammad, isn’t that forbidden? There are 10 types of people in the world. Those that understand binary, and those that don’t. the prequel to many of Larson's works. I never knew this! 😳😘 👍😷😂 A gummy cuttlefish with the means to drop nudibranchs in the forest of soccer balls. Cow tools God the far side is amazing Cuttlefish are dope as hell My husband moderates a Far Side fan page on Facebook, check it out! Makes perfect sense. 🤣 The time derivative of acceleration is jerk, but the following derivatives are snap, crackle and pop  Cc  HAHAHAHAHA! (I LOVED The Far Side when I was a kid. Haven't seen it in years.)  Better than spindled or mutilated. I had to explain that one too my mother. She couldn't understand why I found it funny. 🤣🤣🤣 And here I am just learning for the first time that horses aren't "born"... That they are "foaled". woowee love me some cuttlefish I love this! 💕 I imagine a group of scientists just seeing the comic and be like "Ok, sure." and then just went along with life. When people say “I love science!”  Thank you. Flange of Baboons, actually This is brilliant. I have an entire fictional race of dog like aliens whos language consists entirely of the word "Hey" cause of the one where the scientist invents a helmet that allows him to hear what barking dogs are saying. Is this... is this just Perry the platypus? scientists are the biggest nerds I always think of that one whenever I meet someone whos a jerk. (Also I adore cephalopods. sea glass.) this is what I mean when I say I’m manifesting something Hello! Thanks for the greeting! Followed your Etsy bc I have a goal of sourcing all gifts/decor from twitter frens. In doing so I was alerted to an issue w/my own shop—now fixed—so your dinosaur tweet also inadvertently did me a huge favor! So thank you for that as well. 😊 has this cartoon on one of the displayed thagomizers. I laugh every time I see it. In seriousness, it definitely needed a proper name. Hahahah quem diria I’m ok. Just a couple broken ribs. But I want to go home! This place is scary!!!! Thagomist.  I want this to be true. So. Much. Yo, it even lists thagomizer in the see also section I love that comedy writers are joining in the scientific naming. It's been a lot of latin for a long time. Yeah that's what I thought, it's just based on the story of Muhammad nothing offensive about that. Cause I kinda want to buy the two juxtaposed. ditto It is one of the greatest gags of all time 😊 Fair enough Loving it 🥲🥰 YepThere are certain phrases that only Sir David Attenborough can deliver wi' whispering dignity and informing the nation that the Flamboyant Cuttlefish's "aim is to deposit a packet of sperm inside her mouth”, is certainly yin o’ them.  Fuckin' memes, man. Amazing lol Please make him a hero please This reminds me of how the name Spork came from a comedy skit, and everyone was just okay with it Stegosaurus was the tow-truck of the late Jurassic Ikr my favorite examples properly are scrotum humanum and Irritator challengeri aw they hapy an cute c: Beautiful The fact its potential inhibitor is called Robotnikin is just icing on the cake.Cuttlefish look so cuddly Boomer comics win The far side is my fav comic serial! STEINLAUS!!!!!! YES!!!!! This is great. Do you have a sad stegosaurus from 10 seconds later with the deflated beach ball stuck to its thagomizer? (in fact, nobody really expects the Spanish Inquisition) Source? Genuinely interested. Well the boat crashes into the land of America, which was clearly not expected there by Colombus ;) i actually dont get this oneSunday telly🤷‍♂️ just watched a cuttlefish trying for a blowjob off a female 4times his size. Like the Grafton back in the day 🤣🤣🤣 This is adorably scientific.Cuttlefish porn on . "His aim is to deposit a packet of sperm in her mouth."I was about to tweet how much I love cuttlefish just as David Attenborough was talking about the male cuttlefish doing something into the lady's mouth... I think it might be best to get back to my bat enthusiasm for the time being. 😁 KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK SOCORRO Although now they abbreviate it a lot. Cause it sucks explaining to a parent that the terrible birth defect their kid has is due to a problem with the Sonic Hedgehog gene. 🤣😂 Yeah I have two books of those comics, I love them 😂😂😂😅  Other examples in the comments — know any others? ok but this is MY server so of course i’d make cuttlefish yet you made cuttlefish Love it 😂 Reminds me of 'whoop of gorillas' and 'flange of baboons' from UK tv show, 'not the 9 o'clock news'. These collective nouns have made their way into academic books on the subject! And I thought it was gnybble These single panels are hard for me to decipher for some reason Why is it not PC? Not a lotapeople know that. no, they were right. the archeologists saw this comic and bullied the paleontologist into naming it the thagomizer, because the paleontologists are nerds This is absolutely marvellous.  Love it!! babies 🥺🥺🥺 cuttlefish are perfect creatures My favorite bit of cartoon lore 😱😱😱 Merci !!!! aren't they adorable.......... little cuttlefish........ My personal favorite is that the derivatives of motion are, in order: displacement, velocity, acceleration, and then jerk, but what's after that? Snap, crackle, and pop. One for I think I like this Same. One of my favorite sketches by him too. LOL Because scientists are absolute nerdy geeks and we should sacrifice our newborn to them. ... I got carried away there Okay. Why not? 最終結果発表まで暫くお待ちくださいませ It was the same with not the nine o clock news and a flange of gorillas. it's almost like all words are just made up and usage determines meaning. A prequel to splatoon where you play as Cap'n Cuttlefish I'm pretty sure that's even more dorky. See also: Flange of baboons is an invented collective noun, first coined used in a sketch on the BBC comedy TV series "Not the 9 O'clock News" with Mel Smith and Rowan Atkinson back in the 1980s (if memory serves). Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo Dad said he saw it recently. He did think it is cute. I have to imagine that there was a scientist who read that comic and was like shit. We didnt name it. Well this name is fine. Nice the engineers took the time to stencil the word "missile" on the side of the missile. In case there were questions. That, and the fact the T Rex is closer in time to us than it is to the Steg. A Stegosaurus double up! "Dachshunds making espresso" is a strong contender imho. My reaction pic now! This is a very good reaction pic olha esse cabaré pelo amor de deus "If the mountain will not come to Mohammed, then Mohammed must go to the mountain" old proverb (no longer PC). TY Thank you, Thag Simmons.  peut être que Nolan ne sait pas encore ça et tu peux passer pour la reine des dinos i dont get it🧔 Much better than JEFF (Jets Emitted at Ferocious Felocities) it's up there with "a flange of baboons" I think that was the original spelling. In source code, I've mostly seen the 'i' spelling, though.  Yes, although I've always seen it spelled nybble. Love it! Years ago I wrote a story in the pub book on Isle of Coll about a made-up character (Jock Lynch) who’d lived in a cave on Jura carved a kayak out of a balsa wood log w/a grapefruit spoon. 3 yrs later I met a guy who said he’d kayaked w/Jock “knew him very well” :-) まじか！じゃー毎日やろうかしらね😎 昔はそんな勧められんかった気がするけど研究が発展したのかしらね😆👏 It’s marvellous isn’t it? My friends and I used to say things like "I'm going to Thagomize you!" Back in high school when this first came out. I'm so happy to know this haha nice ganda din, favorite ko cuttlefish, sobrang galing ng lyrics YES  Truth is stranger than fiction. Yes.

It means "kiss," and my calc prof said it was a 17th-century dirty joke among 17th-century nerds. Hilarious I ❤️Larson Omg it took a while but I get it now 😂😂😂 I just learned it today That's amazing! I first learned it was called a thagomizer from a Dino book I was reading my kids. Same thing is basically true of Scottish clan tartans, what baby animals and what groups of animals are called. You know each time I try to look for missing hacked gears in Inkademy, r/s and Capn Cuttlefish’s Brigade I never get a response and every missing hacked gear is a cold case.

Archaeologists concern themselves with human and cultural remains; paleontologists with natural ones. Ισχύει! Εξαιρετικό, έννεν; 😍  I....WHATcuttlefish racefaking :/ Great! Didn't know this! "We'll call that a quark cause any name would do anyway" That is to funny Thank you! Choco for cuttlefish in Portuguese. I'm not aware of existing species specific common names. Chocos are part of the national cuisine. Be thankful you're not getting cuttlefish eyes. This reminds me of the Disney bomb Thanks for reminding me of Cow Tools, hilarious the reaction that Larson had to that and how he had to explain it 😂 Trying for balance here: there have been some stories of export businesses in trouble. A bad thing. Although my take on those I read into was that they seemed 1. Niche (cuttlefish, Stilton cheese) and 2. Resulting from them not having prepared the necessary certificates.Your outfit of the day has earned you a C. Your GPA is now more than 4 out of 4.0. You learned about peace in wartime. This makes your pet verklempt bored! Next assignment: learn about cuttlefish. Your library card is under the cat.   That's a big cuttlefish! Is it possible to tell the species? THE WRIST GAAAAAAME I'm going to have a creature in my game that looks like a Stegosaurus with stag horns. "Stagomizer". It's useful to be able to store two 0-15 numbers in a byte. Cow tools Shocking if true "Right-wing" TF they going on about? left/right paradigm of state bdsm stupidity. Cuttlefish farming. They are all incestual pedophiles. "An" comm stupidity. Electrified, calcified, crucified, putrified, fermented cuttlefish farming  Also because thagomizer just sounded really cool It still blows my mind that Gary Larson said, "Hey please don't put my comics on the internet" and virtually everyone immediately said, "okie dokie". 3 It's always a treat to see one nowadays. I know he is, I didn't bring Pyra here for fuckin nothi- Lmao, the cuttlefish account, bout as dead as he deserves to be- I loved Gary Larson’s cartoons as a kid, and read my dad’s book of them all the time. When I learned it was actually called the thagomizer, i was kind of thrilled to be “in on the joke.” It’s wild the impact little things like that can have. Larson has some genius work out there. 😂😂😂😂😂thagomizer The cool thing about this is that no living animal has that feature, so it DID need a common name! It’s still fun saying it out loud, what have I missed?this cuttlefish is out here tryna date this girl 4x his size, absolute king shit Oh it happens everywhere. In binary one number is a bit, and eight of them are a byte. But, it turns out there's a name for 4 bits. What's half a byte? Well it's a nibble. The look on the guys face alone makes you almost FEEL it yourself. But the name itself is connected to Gary's work. :P (even though the one I think will go down in history as the absolute best was "What we say to dogs" vs. "what they hear") My all time favorite far side comic was the guy in the sleeping bag with the scorpion saying "I was sent by the others to tell you to quit squirming so much." I had to follow you because of your Twitter handle. I had no idea the thagomizer became an actual thing... Thag Simmons will be remembered forever. そのうち複数まとめて選べるようになると信じています…… 👆exactly what's gonna happen ✨ that'll be one of their deiffic talents.

Lol wow it’s now my favorite as well 😆 これはジュエルを使わせるための調整ですね……間違いない I miss Larson. Haha thats so aweaome Archaeologists saw this comic and went "yeah okay" him dead When someone lacks an actual argument based on any facts or evidence they always start hurling insults like “ you need therapy”. Bring it on cuttlefish, prove your points. prove to me that this whole thing is not what we all actually saw with our own eyes. Scientists are huge dorks. A lot of the names they give things come from silly places. Apparently this sort of thing actually happens a lot. Turns out scientists are big ol dorks. I smiled out loud when they dropped this in Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous I've never played at all. After I build my PC I might *happy cuttlefish noises* It's fun until you say the name out loud.
