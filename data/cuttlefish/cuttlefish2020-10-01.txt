Using that information as part of in-game canon, I'm assuming that Cuttlefish and Agent 3 went missing at most, a month before Splatoon 2 started Oh I found more info about the timeline; there were these Squid Sisters Stories on the Splatoon 2 website that tells about what happened before Splatoon 2's Hero Mode saying that Callie, Cuttlefish, and Agent 3's absences happened 9 months after the final Splatfest of Splatoon 1 I think the "2 years back" thing is supposed to be more of 3's battle with Octavio and Calamari Inkantation playing Also I'm pulling this part from the Wiki, apparently 8 actually didn't attack 3 first; Cuttlefish and 3 attacked 8 first, then they were interrupted Splatoon 2 takes place 2 years after the first game. Also it was stated that Agent 8 and 3 were in the middle of a fight, but were interrupted by the Deep Sea Metro events. The Inner Agent 3 fight is implied to just take place in 8's head. Given all this, I'd assume Cuttlefish In Splatoon 2's Octo Canyon mode, there's a Sunken Scroll containing a note from Cuttlefish and Agent 3 saying they went out to a research trip to the cape.

It begs the question, maybe they could have had a feedback loop in clever little guys outsmarting the older would-be Chad cuttlefish, creating pressure for smarter descendants to out-mate. But short-life spans limit it.Cuttlefish live 1-2 years, they are indeterminant mollusk-descended intelligent bebes, start 1/4th of an inch, in 2 months they quadruple, it slows but it keeps going. They die after mating to make way for the next gen. They mate with a face-to-face special tentacle make-out. Better pack your cuttlefish, Stanley.

I'd like to think that was the japan team seriously trying to push this relationship insteadWhen presented with this literal evidence that you get as you play through OE, this kid continues to shovel how she gets so much focus when the point is that, before this, everyone just saw the Octolings the way cuttlefish did, that's what hero mode 1 taught usit's censored but the idea is that the two are so inseparably close if Cuttlefish dare ever lay a finger on her Pearl will defend her. Despite that these two are not related by blood or by species, they've done so much for each other that Pearl considers it unacceptableIt also fleshes out Pearl because she was just bratty before that point, there's a point in the chatlogs where Cuttlefish is still hesitant to trust Marina and sort of hastily brushes his prejudice away and Pearl IMMEDIATELY goes 'if you splat her I will CUT A FISH'Cuttlefish literally fought a war against the Octarians, he's not even fully on your side when you wake up as the Octoling, it's only after he realises you were humming the Squisters's tune does he begin to warm up to youBasically this guy hated pearl in OE because NoA's writing still didn't really do it justice.
