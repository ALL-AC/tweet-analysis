This is totally a dead cuttlefish though. Why people are burying dead cuttlefish? 🤷‍♀️💿; it’s like the dried cuttlefish strips thing💿; my sister is currently eating cuttlefish and now i feel miserable bc the whole room smells like it and all i can think of is that gimgs balls smell like that コピー本すか！そんな無理ゲーw 千鶴さんってなんかタイミング的にこの時期なんですよね誕生日だったり野村さんもこの時期に結婚したりとwA reconstituted cuttlefish with the training to fight minivans while hunting souls. ぼくのサービス落とさないで……Ika (烏賊, いか): Cuttlefish or Squid, served raw or cooked 571bd84ce785453a8adb590a4f9f789f 原稿で燃え尽きてしまったので後半くらいからがんばりまs It’s a cuttlefish. They’re great grilled. You can keep or remove the ink sack, it’s tastier with the ink, but your teeth go black hah. Anyway that one’s dead, so I wouldn’t recommend eating it.People are and will increasingly become like cuttlefish. Their external appearance communicating internal thoughts and ideas. A "mood ring" worn on the body, the hair, the skin, the face, and pierce-able fleshy lobes 理想的ムーブdatin fish princesses i had to learn to like small crabs an cuttlefish 💙 R dey sum kind of Cuttlefish 💙 めちゃくちゃ嬉しそうなんですよ！！wwwwやはり小さくても機材マニアなのか…www でも脈拍ってわかりますよ！！長さもばっちりですし、接続部がゴムってところが便利で！！✨✨✨ いやこれほんとすごいっすね…ONKYOのガチャが出てるなんて知りませんでした🤭これは全部欲しくなる…！！ His style is amazing - was hoping to get one before I left for Australia but I ran out of money 😂 Planning a cuttlefish, coral, crabby marine-scene forearm band from him!If hammerheads are masters of predation, are expert survivors. These 'chameleons of the sea' can rapidly change the colour, pattern and texture of their skin. They can shape shift to look like crabs, sand, algae and rocks. 5/ If that ain't a Christmas best-seller in the making my cock's a cuttlefish That is a buried cuttlefish (Sepia) Are you saying you don't respect the burial traditions of cuttlefish, Hank? Yes defo a cuttlefish we get them here however I fear this video falls in the same area as the getting different animals out of holes. It's all faked for Instagram etc and seems pretty abusive to animals.35- Sunkissed 36- Light Butterscotch 37- Golden Daffodil 38- Thatch 39- Ocean Salt 40- Mellow Glow 41- Namaqua Daisy 42- Cuttlefish 43- Whirlwind 44- Stardust 45- Periwinkle Palace 46- Bird's Egg 47- North Island 48- Eye of the Storm 49- Winter Heaven 50- Mamello 35- Sunkissed 36- Light Butterscotch 37- Golden Daffodil 38- Thatch 39- Ocean Salt 40- Mellow Glow 41- Namaqua Daisy 42- Cuttlefish 43- Whirlwind 44- Stardust 45- Periwinkle Palace 46- Bird's Egg 47- North Island 48- Eye of the Storm 49- Winter Heaven 50- Mamello 同じだ！6限zoom もしかして、教職概論？ そうそう、そんな感じです。円だったら普通に等分でできますので試してみてください。 一様に打つと準モンテカルロ積分法ですね。 嫌がらせみたいな図形でなければ大丈夫だったはずです。The Meteor Flamboyant CuttlefishHello my fellow american friend Cuttlefish,would you like a hambaga? Why you so sad cuttlefish? Who hurt you? Oh it’s definitely a buried dead cuttlefish, no monster, fear not such "fresh" condition. So since there are a ton of (unethical and sad) videos of similar actions, it'd be a safe bet that these people buried the cuttlefish and made it seem "naturally" found as seen. (Hopefully it wasn't alive when buried at the very least) the sand, let alone this far up on shore to get beached and buried (it'd require a substantial amount of effort to get buried like that I feel, especially by natural means if the current). If anything, a dead cuttlefish would be quickly scavenged off of before being buried in Eh, I'd think if they were really beach cleaning and saw an animal-like thing sticking out of the sand, you wouldn't be removing it out of it's home while also recording. At least, any practical and ethical beach cleaner shouldn't do so. Second, cuttlefish wouldn't be found in I think since it looks pretty stiff from rigor mortis, vs a very floppy cuttlefish when alive, I'd bet they buried it when dead and waited for the current to "hide" it. I'd hope it wasn't buried alive :( What a terrible thing to do for a video, but I've seen multiple similar vids I've eaten enough cuttlefish to identify that immediately. 😅A chocolate nail with the talent of being able to run faster than cuttlefish below the forest of buns.datin fish princesses i had to learn to like small crabs an cuttlefish Cuttlefish or Eldritch abomination. Just kidding, they’re the same thing. Best squid sister is Cuttlefish I can confidently say after viewing it’s a cuttlefish... but what on earth is happening in this video? Who knows. Dead creatures wash up on shore frequently, but it couldn’t have sat there long enough to actually be buried in the sand. Birds would’ve gotten to it. 100% staged Ah! Thanks for pointing that out! I only watched the video a couple of times and I missed that. I believe the structure they grab it by is actually its siphon, which cuttlefish and other cephalopods use to move and as part of respiration. Just a dead cuttlefish that got swept in with the tide and buried in the waves Tagging He knows a thing or two about cuttlefish and might be able to help! Yeah I think there was, if so this is quite sad, because cuttlefish are such amazing creatures and shouldn't be treated this way even after death When the tide comes in, sand would be carried with it, along with the dead cuttlefish, burying it.OK, we have confirmation that it's a giant cuttlefish and that it is almost definitely already dead. Why it is buried in the sand??? No idea... Apparently it's a cuttlefish. No no...I think it's the siphon...I am not good at cuttlefish anatomy... It appears to be some sort of cephalopod. Most likely a cuttlefish. I’m pretty sure it’s a cuttlefish. Hey Hank! That's a dead cuttlefish! Why the hell it's buried in the sand like this, I DO NOT KNOW. (this pokémon is based on the cuttlefish) I also think it's some kind of cuttlefish (correct number of legs and tentacles; some of the coloration seems to match). It is large (though some do get that large) and I haven't ever heard of them burrowing in sand (though I don't see why not I guess). Guys, he's talking about the grabby arm, not the cuttlefish. Those things are amazing. The cuttlefish, I mean. Cuttlefish are the coolest. Looks like it could be a cuttlefish Everybody's saying cuttlefish, and it kinda looks like one, but it's hard to tell seeing it from underneath like that. Dead cuttlefish that they buried so they could dig it up in a tik tok? Looks like they buried a dead cuttlefish for views Obviously a cuttlefish and they do bury themselves in sand. Not sure why one would do it in an area where the tide would go out though. Kantbot = bootleg Crypto Cuttlefish Think it's a cuttlefish stuck in the sand Sorry silap sikit haha Squid = normal sotong at pasar Cuttlefish = sotong katak Octopus = sotong kurita DEFINITELY CUTTLEFISH. yeah, a cuttlefish. How about a cuttlefish eating a gooey duck? Dead cuttlefish, not alive, washed up on beach, buried in sand; rare because normally only the cuttlebone makes it to the beach. Dead cuttlefish that I’m guessing they buried for the video. Australian giant cuttlefish get up to 4 ft or more, but I think that’s a different species. European common cuttlefish, maybe? Cuttlefish! Oh I know! It’s animal abuse! It’s a cuttlefish. They are pelagic, so they don’t burrow down into the sand like this. Whoever made this video took (what appears to be a live) cuttlefish and buried it in the sand to make this video. “Oh! Ok.” The zapfish falls out. Dear cod why did cuttlefish pick her. (I’ll tell you. She was the only one willing to invade an alien society for anger relief and a happy meal.) Actually no, they didn’t give a clear image on the Wikipedia, its not the O. kaurna. Its probably just a cuttlefish. Yeah looks like a cuttlefish. Right number of legs with the two tenticles and the head pattern looks right. If its a fake rubber one its a pretty nice model I'm voting cuttlefish. It looks cuttlefish, it must have dug itself in the sand while the tide was up. I think the grabber was pulling on its eye? It may have already been dead from the lack of ocean water. I’m willing to bet that it’s a cuttlefish. Definitely looks like a cuttlefish to me. I’m going for real, but dead, degraded, and at an odd angle. Maybe a cuttlefish but seems rather large, some kind of squid though for sure. My first thought was either a cuttlefish/some other bizarre cephalopod, but seeing the other joke comments, I now have the Hakuna Matata parody "Cthulhu Fhtagn" in my head. "Cthulhu Fhtagn - now we're in for strange days! It screws with your noggin - turns planets into buffets!" I believe its a type of cuttlefish, but it DAMN sure isnt the bobtail one. Looking up other squids will update asap Looks like a cuttlefish, with the back towards the camera. Not sure if it's made of rubber or real, though. Just based on the placement of what would be the funnel (the bit sticking up out of the sand), I'm feeling very sure that isn't a cuttlefish so it would have to lean more squid. probably some sort of cephalopod, it is real. there are some real obvious similarities to a cuttlefish, but this is a weird angle, so i'm not positive. but it probably serves no real danger to humans aside from Maybe Possibly poisonous It almost looks like it could be a large cuttlefish flattening itself out. Isn't that a cuttlefish? Looks like a dead cuttlefishIka (烏賊, いか): Cuttlefish or Squid, served raw or cooked f2e59bc95e8d4ed7b9787de456a0a370 THIS HOW YOU FEEL. MEET ME AT SORTING FACTORY!!!
