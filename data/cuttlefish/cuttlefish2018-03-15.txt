Captain Cuttlefish could be genetically changing Inklings so that they are Octolings and see if they are any different That could be the reason for the test tubes and the amnesia and the training area! Cuttlefish still fresh as everCaptain Cuttlefish rocking the ill Master Roshi tracksuit in that Splatoon trailer Makes sense, agent 3 was known to be with cuttlefish elsewhere on the planet... It's adorable! No longer merely a cuttlefish, it is now a cuddlefish LOLSplatoon 2 DLC. Playable octolings. Callie's back. Cap'n Cuttlefish and Agent 3 are back. EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED IS COMING TRUE. I'm really hyped to see how they handle the story. Also about Agent 3 and Capn Cuttlefish. This is the mission Marie mentioned to Agent 4!!! DO NOT CUDDLE THE CUTTLEFISHwhy does agent 8 look like that. why is she dressed like that. why is cuttlefish looking at her like thatOther notables i forgot to mention: 1. Callie is back 2. Tons of new gear 3. Captain Cuttlefish plays a part in the Octo Expansion 4. Off the Hook development in Octo Expansion 5. Inklings in Smash 5 Also need big change in U.K. consumer preferences - we import most of the fish we eat (white) from Northern European waters whilst exporting c80% of UK landed catch to Southern Europe who eat a lot more cuttlefish, herring, mackerel etc than we do. Yo Rockenberg Cuttlefish is still here as wellim really happy now we get: - a sea cucumber - pearl marina in single player - capn cuttlefish not being dead - playable octolings what more could i possibly needStart of Splatoon 2's Hero mode. Marie mentions that Agent 3 and Captain Cuttlefish are out on a mission or something together. This new single player expansion showed both of them, maybe? Could this be what they were up to? This would explain why Cap'n Cuttlefish and Agent 3 were gone?!! I have been staring at my screen with my mouth open omgcan I commission someone to draw Cuttlefish in an Adidas tracksuit and timbsI screamed so loud when they announced the splatoon update omg Octolings are playable!!!!! Aaaa!!! And Callie is in story mode and she is adorable Also pearl, Marina and captain cuttlefish are going to be in the new mode aaa!!

I'm guessing it's taking place during Agent 3 and Cuttlefish's trip? I'm so excited ;_; especially to finally play as an Octoling! They listened to the fans ❤️So Octoexpansion is basically what Cuttlefish and Agent 3 were doing during the events of Splatoon 2 and Pearl and Marina are agents now too, also shows octolings being friendly to inklings more THAT FUCKING MUSIC AND STYLE THO CAPN CUTTLEFISH WHAT IS YOU DOINWHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
