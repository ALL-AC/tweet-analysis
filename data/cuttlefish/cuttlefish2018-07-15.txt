Even if we were to assume that literally every single Inkling/Octoling that exists besides Marina, Pearl, Callie, Marie, Capn Cuttlefish, and Octavio WERE 14-16, Inklings may reach full maturity earlier than humans, especially seeing as Inklings don't mature much beyond 14 years. I think Pearl and Marina are trying to avoid a confrontation in terms of the other Inklings discovering there are Octarians in their midst. Plus, seeing as the only ones aware of the Octolings are Agents 3, 4, Callie, Marie, Pearl, Marina and Capt.

Now, not every "participant" was an Octoling, but all test subjects!But then this crusty old war bigot has the tenacity to sling bars (including more violence)?!
