Blaming it on a few people who call you out for writing an unresearched fluff piece praising Wolf for his lies isn't going to help you at all. Looks like an old one, judging by the thick stem. 20 years? I wonder what it lived through; stupendous storms, cuttlefish clashes, nudibranch nibblings, seaweed sex, towed-gear turmoil. I've done what I could to be very specific about the issue I have with your article. You've chosen to take it personally. No one is bullying you. But thanks for comparing us to Trump. Super classy. That's great that writing false info about Wolf "serves you." Too bad about the other people he harmed and those of us who would be harmed by having to deal with an unqualified candidate running in our District. It's nice to know it's all about you not your community. It's not about "making fun of" the things you like. It's about sharing information we've discovered through MONTHS of research into Wolf. You ARE wrong about him. That's a fact. What you wrote about him is wrong. Fact. Whatever else you like-you be you. We're pointing out that the candidate you support-in the District where I live-is a liar dangerous person bc he's not qualified to hold public office. No one else gets hurt if you like the Cubs ... If Wolf is elected, his constituents (me/my kids) are hurt. Up here, so at one with the infinite but so desperately remote I’ve shared a joke with a cuttlefish. They’re jerks, BTW.cuttlefish 7 de 23 ITS SO BAD KIRBY I HATE IT Wouldn’t you agree that Ben was the bully in that scenario? I can only speak for myself, but I am definitely not being paid by anyone. I simply care about the truth, and your piece unfortunately does a disservice to that pursuit. Do you not feel any responsibility to at least publish a correction? Like I said - tell me the Twitter handles and I'll report them and get others to report them as well. That's how you stop it. As far as the industry you work in, I'm aware because I have experience in the same industry. So you have to learn to protect yourself by doing at least basic research about the people you get involved with. No, the truth doesn't always come out and people don't always seem to care what the truth is. Trump is President. I don't want Wolf running for office anywhere - he is unqualified and he is dangerous. I haven't done that nor have I seen any of that. I'm sorry that's happening to you but it's not related to anything I've done. You should report those accounts and if you give me the Twitter handles, I'll report them as well Yes, he has. Just because he's been nice to you doesn't mean he "hasn't done anything wrong." You don't feel like correcting your mistake in publishing false information given to you by someone you thought you could trust. I can understand that too. But understand that for those of us who know how bad Wolf is, any praise of him is dangerous. No one is bullying you. You are feeling defensive which I can understand. You wrote an article repeating his lies about his background. You clearly did no research. No one is trashing you personally. Just asking why you support and write about a candidate who has lied about so much? No one is trashing you for turning tragedy into triumph. I think that's great. What we're doing is raising issues about Wolf's total lack of integrity and his manipulative narcissism.cuttlefish are Superior in every waydatin fish princesses i had to learn to like small crabs an cuttlefish I love watching documentaries on cuttlefish!
