They will pass fighting males to get close to females, and then change their color to reveal their true gender. The female is often sufficiently impressed. It’s funny because dealing with Climate Change itself requires the same abilities as the Marshmallow Test tasks. Delayed gratification and the ability to see long term rewards at the expense of short term gain. Sadly “conservatives” are failing miserably. Cuttlefish do better. Cuttlefish for Acting AG; can't do a worse job than the incumbent - and never needs a whiteboard for camouflage.

Yea how we go from smart as a kid cuttlefish to politics it you fkn American s leave it alone let it die quietly FFS and u still wear a mask ffs If cuttlefish designed tests for human children the way human adults design intelligence tests for animals, the human child would fail because it didn't have tentacles. You say this like Cuttlefish are not objectively superior beings Everytime he gets caught he gives the fisherman a note saying he's I'll and needs to go back incase he infects the other dumber cuttlefish wearin a lol mask n shit Got nothing witty Jules... yay cuttlefish!!People keep posting this cuttlefish shit without realizing dogs and birds did the same thing years ago l personally welcome our cuttlefish overlords.

Shannon is smarter than the entire GOP all together! And I’ll take the cuttlefish on my quiz bowl team vs the GOP. Cuttlefish may be the best nemesis yet. Been reading how smart and stealthy cuttlefish are. Fascinating creatures. Ur cuter than a cuttlefish ya freaky bitch Spent nearly a 1/2 hour playing a cuttlefish -seemed like an intelligent creature. I hate the marshmallow test so much. They should get cuttlefish to design a better one.testing to see whether cuttlefish have been traumatized and forced into scarcity mindset yet I'd rather have a cuttlefish than a small child. At least the cuttlefish have more of a spine than the PMI just read an article about cuttlefish passing the "marshmallow test." I'm picturing them shuffling their tentacles, waiting impatiently to get that second marshmallow. 😂🥰 heart cuttlefish they’re so cooli hope cuttlefish will be just and benevolent rulersDem cuttlefish is basic.

Right, so moved to Portugal last autumn before the shutters came down on jan 1st, got introduced to choco frittas (fried cuttlefish) accompanied by lemon Mayo and a nice cold glass (bottle) of white, delicious! I have these thoughts about stopping consuming cephalopods They’re clearly intelligent, to the problem solving level Of course that would be pointless hypocritical without going at least vegetarian Fundamentally there’s no difference between a haddock a cuttlefish He’s a cuttlefish ^^” A cuttlefish duh I'm not a fan of science proving cuttlefish are better than meI guess it’s cool that a cuttlefish can “pass” the marshmallow test but that test doesn’t predict future success more than it highlights economic disparity and how kids growing up with financial instability develop vastly different behavioral patterns than wealthy kids Cuttlefish! I am ashamed that my industry used cuttlefish for casting. I never did it in school and don't know much about it, but I know I will never try it. I never thought about until one day I saw a cuttlefish in a film and it made me sick. i bet a cuttlefish would eat an entire box of samoas How do we know that this "god" fellow isn't a cuttlefish? "Two additional cuttlefish were recruited to the study but refused to take part." How? Did they refuse to sign the consent form? The birth of cuttlefish twitter Cuttlefish are smart AF !!!!! You absolutely *were* and are on the cutting edge of cuttlefish culture! GIVE US THE CUTTLEFISH!!! cuttlefish newsFurthermore, as was raised, a significant factor not immediately accounted for was scarcity of resources. If there was less food available, my guess is the cuttlefish tends to opt for the prawn, especially if the time delay is greater.Mind you, any conclusions from this are extrapolated. Not like they could ask the cuttlefish why they did it.The study with the cuttlefish was cool and all, but the headline was misleading (of course). Wasn't a written test, but a simple measure of capability to delay gratification (and only for like TWO minutes). No 1:1 with actual child intelligence, and birds and primates did it too. Don't insult that sweet cuttlefish like that Fun anecdote: I saw a cuttlefish at the Monterey Bay Aquarium that liked to imitate the back of your phone when you would take a picture of them ^.^me: hey, did you know that a cuttlefish passed a test for human children? my brother: CUTTLEFISH ARE REAL??? I THOUGHT THEY WERE FROM SUBNAUTICAOH NO, CUTTLEFISH IS ABOUT TO COME OUT OF MY ASSHOLE I think the common knowledge ones are the ones you learn from the ABC of animal books and Cat is always beating Cuttlefish to the top! haha! Octavio being the main story villain would just be a bit overdone. Have him make music with Cuttlefish and the idols. We already know Pearl and Cuttlefish are great rappers. Cuttlefish are super smart and make wonderful pets. Cuttlefish have more will power than Republican politicians do. So the difference between an oligarch and a cuttlefish is that the latter is smart enough to be able to delay gratification while the former opens schools and kills kids and ruins the economy it wants to save because it lacks any ability to think ahead. YES. I will submit to the cuttlefish and octopus willingly. Lmao cuttlefish lol"We always used to pick up cuttlefish skeletons and give them to our birds" won't get any better texts today Methinks, this experiment can be conceived as classical conditioning as well. The cuttlefish associate night with grass shrimp under condition 1, but not under condition 2. 3/3 I for one welcome our new cuttlefish overlords Oh, cuttlefish are very bright. They will (re) inherit the earth.... The study from 2020 set cuttlefish in two conditions. Under condition 1, grass shrimp were predictable present at night, under cond. 2, their presence was not predictable. Under c. 1, cuttlefish reduced their daytime consumption of the less preferred crabs, but not under c 2. 2/nasi que cuttlefish es sepia..........Anglerfish Cuttlefish I love cuttlefish!

Thank you cuttlefish. Cuttlefish are fascinating. yeah cuttlefish are based Let's give a cuttlefish the "Person, woman, man, camera, TV" test and see how it does. I went to an aquarium that had a tank full of like a dozen cuttlefish and the aquarist was like "there were two-dozen in here at the beginning of the month but they'll eat each other if they see an opportunity" and that's haunted me ever since Hubs says they're delicious, but I'm not about it. He feels bad about eating so many dried cuttlefish now, I can tell you that! there is a species of cuttlefish that can shoot their penis from a distance I read Jules Verne. I’m not fucking with any cuttlefish. I'd vote for the cuttlefish over Marjorie Taylor Greenei could probably do an entire powerpoint on just how freakin cool the cuttlefish is. "Cuttlefish have been put to a new version of the marshmallow test, and the results appear to demonstrate that there's more going on in their strange little brains than we knew." People are so condescending. Drives me crazy. "strange little brains". Fuck off. Stupid trust fund cuttlefish tryin to make us look bad.... Likely enough that it got the cuttlefish to learn. But Can you tell? If a cuttlefish can cry? Lost like tears in the ocean.My phone repeatedly will change “cuttlefish” to “cuddle fish” and to those that know me, should realize that my phone has has years and countless opportunities to know what I’m saying.There’s no way cuttlefish didn’t evolve their eyes like that just for the flexone time I tried watching someone do a study on cuttlefish and I just cried.dude cuttlefish are pog and the unappreciated cousin of octopus and squid The best cuttlefish bois are the tiny ones that dress up like girls and then fuck the harems right under the bellies of the giant males!Cuttlefish can help protect them against acid rain"That seems like cuttlefish can exert self control, all right, but what's not clear is why. [...] Cuttlefish, as far as we know, don't use tools or cache food, nor are they especially social." Maybe they're just smart and like better food? Squids, octopi and cuttlefish are some next-level weird, in evolutionary terms. Go cuttlefish Aaaw yay! Congratulations cephalopod! I love cuttlefish, they’re so cute Good cuttlefish, nice cuttlefish, sorry about all the times I ate your friends. So... a cuttlefish has more self-control than I do when it comes to food? Nice. Love this post. Cuttlefish have always been my favorite animal. You missed off Cuttlefish Jokes on you cuttlefish now you have 2 things you can’t eat.Thirdly, yes, it's probably intelligence that the cuttlefish learned out of survival But isn't that the point I'm trying to make here... that we need to use our intelligence to change adapt survive on this living planet and the more life we preserve lessens lonely lives etc CUTTLEFISH? Cuttlefish are the best animal! Oh I'm not at all opposed to cuttlefish, who are dreamy *This cuttlefish is the full squid* I love Cuttlefish it's happening. it starts with cuttlefish, it ends with inkling humans, and i'm all for it because that means.........IRL TURF WAR!Lrt Throw back to when I cried over a cuttlefish documentary.

Hey man, I have no problem honoring the cuttlefish - nay, all cephalopods - as my better. They are. They have been. The more I read about Cuttlefish the more confused I am about why they aren’t the dominant earth species. Ok but seriously Cuttlefish are amazing Not sure why I told you this, but Cuttlefish and Octopuses are my favorite animals an are incredibly intelligent. Especially for having no brain and spinal cord. Hawaiian mythology says Octopuses are from another creation não aparece amg ele só fala do bicho kkkk ativa a legenda "cuttlefish" = chocoVery disappointed to find out it’s spelt “Cuttlefish” and not “Cuddlefish”. Cuttlefish are amazing. They can take on any color. One, once on film, was upset he wasn't getting any. A massive male was keeping the females underneath him. This guy changed his pattern to look like a female, the male took him under, he impregnated the female and left Are cephalopods smart or are kids today as dumb as a cuttlefish?i bet a cuttlefish could finish this novel. Cuttlefinish. If it makes you feel better, cuttlefish also have extremely short lifespans, don't they? can wait to send my cuttlefish to college 💗 I'm always amazed that cephalpods have such a short lifespan. Imagine the intelligence they could develop if they lived 20 or 30 years. Only the nautilus has a long lifespan but their brain structure is much simpler than a squid, cuttlefish, or octopus. 🐙🦑 that cuttlefish would love having the option to adopt you. Lacking a society, cuttlefish don't react like thatin trollblox fishing simulator i caught the mythical cuttlefish so many times i think i am just really good at fishing OMG WAIT WHAT When cuttlefish on there one dayTreating pools with chlorine is how they keep cuttlefish from breeding in there First its just two or three but before you know it you've got an entire fleet of nautilii drifting in the deep end and preying on any hapless children that swim out too farI want them to check with the Flamboyant Cuttlefish since it might provide a contrast in their experimental results considering their logic behind why the experiment is working..."[In a different experiment] the cuttlefish that learnt to adapt to [a change] the quickest were also the cuttlefish that were able to wait longer for the shrimp reward." The cuttlefish photo?  A cuttlefish? With executive function? In this economy? Interesting, but have to wonder about the ethics of such a study. I realise the experiment itself was not cruel, but should the cuttlefish be in a lab at all? Especially when it seems like kind of trivial research."Cuttlefish in the present study were all able to wait for the better reward and tolerated delays for up to 50-130 seconds, which is comparable to what we see in large-brained vertebrates such as chimpanzees, crows and parrots,""The doors also had symbols on them that the cuttlefish had been trained to recognise."they have grown up knowing that there might not be food on the table tomorrow no matter how many promises there are so they need to use what is there. there's no correlation between it and future success. it works with cuttlefish cause cuttlefish don't have socioeconomic inequity Me too 😭 they’re just so weird and fascinating. I have a little cuttlefish tattoo! Wise cuttlefish? I need to be more cuttlefish.i read the cephalopod cognitive test article and ofc, the headline is p misleading and isolating the specific reasons the cuttlefish involved are able to pass the marshmallow test requires further testing BUT anyone who knows me knows what way this is my insane niche interest Of course you have, you little cutie, I always believed in you. You can do great things, cuttlefish 💖 Given the option I would be happy to adopt a cuttlefish. Oh no are they stuck as a cuttlefish? Have they been a cuttlefish for too long?! person, man, cuttlefish, camera... I love cuttlefish!I was so scared to go snorkeling (because sharks) and it was one of the coolest experiences I’ve had so far. Saw an octopus, sea turtle, cuttlefish, barracudas, and so much more. So happy I did it!I would like to be a cuttlefish. If a cuttlefish can pass the test, then we should be able to do it too. 😸 I guess I should stop eating cuttlefish 😖 What?

Cuttlefish...were all able to wait for the better reward tolerated delays for up to 50-130 secs, which is comparable to what we see in large-brained vertebrates such as chimpanzees, crows parrots," Cuttlefish don't delay my gratification! If one isn’t madly in love with the ceph hierarchy (1. Octopus 2. Cuttlefish 3. Squid 4. Miscellany), is one truly living? I'm tellin ya, they are gonna market it with salmonids or cuttlefish or something... omg I actually did do a cuttlefish post today can you do ocean critters like sea slugs or cuttlefish? Are we sure it was cuttlefish and not cthulhu?today the cuttlefish's ingenuity transfixes me: tomorrow I forget, imagine cities are real  Cuttlefish are so cool. "Cuttlefish show they can be patient and ignore a snack that’s right in front of them to hold out for a more tantalizing treat."Just found out I love cuttlefish Cuttlefish most underrated animal. A lot of cuttlefish I've seen kept in lab environments are in pretty spartan tanks without much in the way of cover or stimulation so i imagine it's possible the ones in question were just super stressed and nervous. They're pretty secretive animals w/ lots of natural predators I once ate baby cuttlefish soup. Never again! They have brains! Slightly terrifying? If cuttlefish ruled the world? same please let me be friends w a cuttlefishThe only reason the octopuses and cuttlefish haven't united and risen up to take on humans for dominance is because they have incredibly short lifespans (1 to 5 years). Even if they only lived 20 years, we'd be toast. Cuttlefish and crustaceans. They can both get to fuck. Remember when we went to an aquarium?  It's super interesting because the Marshmallow Test doesn't test your ability for long-term reasoning, it tests your ability to trust adults that there will be more food later. Cuttlefish live in an environment where it's easy for them to thrive, right? When we inevitably cause our own fiery destruction, the cuttlefish will rise to power Cuttlefish...auto correct Cuttlefish baba. Not cattle and fish. I too love a good steak and Hilsa and illisch (as wud be obvious by the spelling errors - not bong - but in and embrace with one..... err.... I digress... So, it’s cuttlefish and not cattle fish. And don’t tell me it’s autocorrect 🤣🤣🤣cuttlefish crow are the ones to be watching out for After watching a fascinating docu on cuttlefish we fell in love with them Right on, the Kommondant of the Castle, and his Cuttlefish, with a fk tonne of small print and a fresh bucket of aqua scoobie. These cephalopods -- cuttlefish, squid, and octopus -- are so intelligent, it's actively tragic. Imagine what they might achieve if they lived for more than a year or two. A better candidate for "uplift" can hardly be imagined, if uplift was a moral or ethical thing to do. So now we know that obesity is a useful indicator of intelligence and that many of the obese people wandering our streets and supermarkets are not as intelligent as cuttlefish. Excellent progress!Lrt society if cuttlefish were in charge  Cuttlefish appreciation post... I like thisI, for one, welcome our new cuttlefish overlords We should all aim to be as thoughtful and restrained as a cuttlefish I love cuttlefish and octopi 🐙 god I love cuttlefishDolphins? People.

So mesmerising to watch! Hypnotic! When I come back in reincarnation, I want to be a Cuttlefish! I liked the rather blasé way the writer mentioned in passing that the cuttlefish had been trained to recognize symbols. That was a stop and re-read moment for me. So, what this article is saying is West Virginia and Arizona would be better off with a cuttlefish than two of their supposedly Democrat senators? You’re not wrong. Precedent shows that if a cuttlefish has the temperament of a human child, then it is qualified to serve 1 term as President of the United States. Oh wow, that gif sure is something. I am speechless. I want to see cuttlefish eating marshmallows when we go out on the town with our complementary octopus and cuttlefish tattoos!!!! when i get a cuttlefish tattoo... Cuttlefish in the present study were all able to wait for the better reward and tolerated delays for up to 50-130 seconds, which is comparable to what we see in large-brained vertebrates such as chimpanzees, crows and parrots," Schnell said. I adore cuttlefish, at the aquarium i always spend at least 20 minutes at the cuttlefish tank Like is this account pro eating cuttlefish tho? CC:  I'll have to disagree on this one. I'm not sure about cuttlefish intelligence, but we're pretty squeamish about eating porpoises and primates. I still don't want to eat bugs. I immediately forgot what the circle, square triangle represented. It’s safe to say that Cuttlefish are smarter than me... and I’m okay with it.I kin cuttlefish'Cuttlefish have been put to a new version of the marshmallow test, and the results appear to demonstrate that there's more going on in their strange little brains than we knew.'

The world will end with a bang and whimper and a cuttlefish なるほど。でもなんだかあまりメリットを感じない制度ですね…(単純に聞き慣れてないだけ？) I mean what did you expect! We are talking about cuttlefish here...remember that scene in Avengers 2 when Andy Serkis was ranting about cuttlefish? WTF was that? テストだけでokということですかね？ やっぱり倫理違反はろくな結果にならないよ。本当に… ah, but how old was the cuttlefish?! that's gotta make a difference...... あっ… いやいや、それ以前にゴッドハンドとか、アメリカの大詐欺師とか… そうですね。Fの場合は教員の開催する再試などで合格すればokです。ちなみにこれは1科目1000円で受験可能。今年度は金銭が免除されたらしいですが The cuttlefish already ate this morning Good on ya.

So, the cuttlefish don’t like marshmallow? うちの評価基準で｢再試・追試資格なし｣ですね。つまり、落第の中で論外を意味します Cuttlefish are so awesome.Cephalopods and cuttlefish. Look it up. Deepfakes, AI and now sea creatures. I probably have worse ADHD than a cuttlefish Strange thing to say. But I've always had a soft spot for cuttlefish. Their design is just so damned impressive. Cuttlefish with a nutcracker a gun. WORLD. DOMINATION. Cuttlefish hungry, but not so much they can't wait for food after they've put in their order, but it'd better be right (no crab, they look nice but the packaging's hard to open you never get as much as you'd think) it'd better not take more than 5mins else there'll be trouble "Scientists showed that common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) can refrain from eating a meal of crab meat in the morning once they have learnt dinner will be something they like much better - shrimp." Teach me your ways, cuttlefishdid you know that cuttlefish mate by not having sex, but the males instead hand the female a sac full of their semen? it doesnt work the same with humans. I have a....uh...friend who tried. There’s no such thing as a cuttlefish Damn! I'll be replacing my cuttlefish then so I'll miss it. I read a thing about the marshmallow test and how it doesn't work if you have experience of precariousness (someone might take the marshmallow before you have a chance) so maybe this indicates cuttlefish don't suffer systemic cultural issues. (I'm hilarious, you're welcome.)Image is picture of cuttlefish and article headline stating “cuttlefish have the ability to exert self-control, study finds” I, for one, salute our new Cuttlefish overlordsHumans possess the same gene that is activated in the largest cuttlefish? Very depressing to learn that, by this measure at least, I am substantially thicker than a cuttlefish あ、離散フーリエ変換の存在は知っているんですが、やり方や詳しい理論を知らなかったので…… はえ～（離散フーリエ変換しらなかった顔） Secret messages sent by dress colour? Like plumage? Or cuttlefish? What? 複素フーリエ級数展開してるのしかわかりません Means that all other creatures must be referred to as un-cuttlefish-like. "Yeah, you should take a page out of Cuttlefish's book and use a Bamboozler for that. The handle makes 'em perfect for it." Sigh... at least this is an opportunity to not think about everything. "I won't bore you to death with all the work details. Save us both the headache." That's a relief. I often thought I had the self-control of a cuttlefish... So if anything like me cuttlefish can't resist chocolate and salty snacks. Good to know. Cuttlefish can be quite generous too, even though a lot of their colleagues are shellfish. yo you better step up your game, even cuttlefish are as smart as you now Can someone genetically modify me with a fucking cuttlefish then????? "chunky squid-like creatures with eight arms" I can never figure out the criteria for "common knowledge" animals. They're pretty common and about as edible as octopus and squid, but you learn the other cephalopods at age 5 while cuttlefish remain specialist knowledge. (apologies for the double 'amazing', I was obviously so excited by another cuttlefish reference that I wasn't paying attention to my words) There was a private function, i was at the action station cooking hot battered cuttlefish and a set of drunk dudes started eating directly from the wok. Was freaking annoying. having known many young human children, it does not shock me in the slightest that cuttlefish can outsmart them. I'd struggle to pass a delayed gratification test tbh. Cuttlefish are clearly more evolved than me 🤷‍♂️ The bit where they decline and die. My god. I was in a worse state of watery disintegration than the poor cuttlefish. This does not surprise me. The Cuttlefish is known for its (almost perverse) enjoyment of delayed gratification. That whole cuttlefish part absolutely slew me! So many twists - the revelation that their eyes don’t see the displays as we do, but something else entirely; the creativity, art and play; that they inhabit the space between intended communication and, say, blush. And then... I was so struck by the story of the cuttlefish just sitting there changing colours for no apparent reason.
