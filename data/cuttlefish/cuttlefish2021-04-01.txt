Lambs brains to toads etc The pope is a cuttlefish and famously bigoted against other cephalopods wow is an emoji used by cuttlefish ocs where do you get cuttlefish? I honestly think they are cuttlefish-squid hybrids. Reason being is that their grandpa is likely meant to be fully cuttlefish, and their names point to them being squids in Japanese, yet they have to have some form of genetic link, since they’re cousins.

But since cuttlefish are so similar to squids, they still fall under the inkling name and can easily blend in with squids Yep, that’s all true! ホタル is the Katakana for ほたる (Hotaru), and that translates directly to Firefly!
