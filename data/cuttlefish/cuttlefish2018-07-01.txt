No, there was no trying to go back to the surface to try any diplomatic talks of reaching a decision to share the zapfish: those inklings had to pay. Especially Cuttlefish.

Then there's the : the females have around 50 tentacles, and the males around 90.  Through the game it's referred to "someone" so I'm guessing it was TarTar who did it, maybe to kill agent 8 and cuttlefish (and probably agent 3 who was supposed to be with them) because they were the only ones who could physically stop his plans?to mate with them (cuttlefish, bluegills, others), or you can be one of thousands of sexes (slime mold, some mushrooms.) Oh, did you mean humans? Oh ok then. You can be male because you were born female, but you have 5-alphareductase deficiency and so you 5/9Honestly the best part of it (besides being an Octoling) is Pearl, Marina, and Captain Cuttlefish's dialogue. Especially the stuff in the chatroom. There's a lot of interesting information and funny moments in there. I wouldn't say cuttlefish is racist, he has a prejudice against octolings but that's because he was in a war, it's a little more nuanced than just hating them because they're octolings. I'm willing to give Captain Cuttlefish a chance because A: he's old B: he's been through war and possibly splatted countless times by Octarians, and C: HE'S TRYING. I liked how Cuttlefish kept reiterating “progressive” slogans from 50 years ago like “I don’t see color” Cuttlefish.. couldn’t believe it .. water is a lot cleaner ..me, before octo expansion: me, now: OCTOLINGS!

Fascinating. What would you call octopuses and cuttlefish? "What...exactly did you unplug, your strategy?" 任せてください()() I only created a twitter account last year so I'm clueless. Was Cuttlefish doxxed or harassed or something? Their twitter account looks like they just stopped posting out of nothing. Well Cuttlefish says etched into her very soul, so I assumed it was some kind of wake up magic.

It’s from there she may have escaped and while trying to leave the valley, she ran into agent 3 and ended up fighting her - in which they were then kidnapped with cuttlefish to the metro. no you have to manually give them to capt. cuttlefish. I assume if/when you make up more than what you owe they take it from you automatically.at least, that would explain why 3 didn't come interrupt the testing to save 8 and cuttlefish earlier. in the time it takes 3 to stealth around the base and get an employee model to track them down, they've completed the testing and the distress signal is activated.using the employee model, 3 is able to get around and hide from tartar much more easily, and is able to locate 8 and cuttlefish. idk i just like the idea of 3 being this stealthy badass.So thats how 8 ends up a test subject instead of being sanitized. while they're being tested, i'm sure 3 is running around inside the levels of the statue trying to find cuttlefish and a way out.

Callie and Marie, aka the Squid Sisters (they're actually cousins) are pop idols and grandchildren to a super-old war veteran Cap'n Cuttlefish. The player character of 1 was recruited as Agent 3 (Callie and Marie are Agents 1 and 2 respectively),Captain Cuttlefish and Marina are fucking artists.i force captain cuttlefish to keep changing his drawing of agent 3 until hes out of paper I thought cuttlefish were different but I want to answer without going to a reference source Cuttlefish certainly do have internalized shells, but this organism is a squid. (there are actually lots of squid with internalized shells but this one is particularly weird). They’re called rams horn squid! Octoling clothing set, and a set of clothing that matches Captain Cuttlefish's outfit in the expansion. CuttlefishThe Octo Expansion ends with Cuttlefish enjoying his time in the Subway, Agent 8 joining the rest of the Octolings and Inklings playing multiplayer, and Pearl and Marina back to being pop stars. Pearl may have not known Marina was an Octoling, but that would be dumb so no. Not a trick, there is a squid with a hard shell inside but cuttlefish is not the answer Cuttlefish DO have internalized shells but they’re their own thing Cuttlefish?Cuttlefish’s Radio is found by Pearl and Marina, and the two help Agent 8 and Cuttlefish along the way. Once the four “Thangs” are found, they transform with the Phone to make a Blender. The phone tricks Agent 8 and Cuttlefish into the Blender.This Octoling was the other to be touched by the Calamari Inkantation. She teams up with Cuttlefish to find the exit. They eventually end up at a telephone. The telephone names the Octoling Test subject 10008, and Cuttlefish shortens it to Agent 8 of the New Squidbeak Splatoon.~14000 but add two years. This Octoling, Agent 3, and Cuttlefish are all knocked Unconcious. Presumably by Commander Tartar. The three are all relocated miles underground. The Octoling and Cuttlefish are lost in a subway with no sign of Agent 3. The Octoling has no memories.Oddly enough Sheldon acts as a weapon supplier for the New Squidbeak Splatoon much like his Grandfather did. Agent 4 soon learns that Agent 3 and Cuttlefish went to patrol Octo Valley, and they didn’t know when they’d be back.Agent 3 eventually defeat Octavio, and frees Cuttlefish along with the Great Zapfish. Marina soon meets Pearl, a... budding rapper... on Mt. Nantai, a nearby location to Octo Valley, the home of Octarians in Splatoon. They become friends and create a band named Off the Hook.Agent 1 is Callie, and Agent 2 is Marie. They end up being Captain Cuttlefish’s grandchildren. Agent 3 eventually finds herself face to face with DJ Octavio. During her long battle with him, The Squid Sisters begin singing their magic song Calamari Inkantation.He tasks Agent 3 with the job of infiltrating the many bases of the Octarians, taking the Zapfish, and eventually getting the Great Zapfish back. DJ Octavio eventually kidnaps Cuttlefish. Agent 3 is assisted by Agents 1 and 2 for the rest of her journey.The Inklings require a large Zapfish called the Great Zapfish to power Inkopolis. This Zapfish is stolen by the Octarians and a recently turned 14 year old female Inkling ends up at the base of Captain Cuttlefish. Cuttlefish names her Agent 3 of the New Squidbeak Splatoon.~14000’s Inkopolis is a bustling city full of Inklings. They prioritize their favorite competitive Sports, Turf Wars, Tower Control, Rainmaker, Splatzones, and their fashion over much else. Captain Cuttlefish and Octavio are still alive as of this time.The leader of the Octarian Army was DJ Octavio. The leader of the Squidbeak Splatoon, aka the Inkling Army, was Captain Craig Cuttlefish. The Squidbeak Splatoon was supplied with Weapons by an inventor named Ammoses Shellendorf. had your cuttlefish, fennel wine recipe tonight..what a treat!Minor Octo expansion spoilers I think the only bad part of the expansion was that it completely debunked my characterization of captain cuttlefish in FAKADS.

You're trying, I guess.The biggest conspiracy the octo expansion has to offer is that every now and then captain cuttlefish will stretch and his bones crack but squids dont have bonesme pearl, at cap'n cuttlefish: were it not for the laws of this land I would have splatted yoube kind to cuttlefish this week, their wholesale slaughter can continue frm monday. thanks in advance Hooray quick review of octo expansion: 1. i love that you can decide the difficulty 2. its hard as shit compared to the base single player but i also like that it was sorta built with speed running in mind 3. cuttlefish was hilarious AF 4. marina and pearl are fucking gay小野さんのツイートで紋甲烏賊をググってみたら英語では kisslip cuttlefish という色っぽい呼び方をするらしい。そういえば確かにモンゴウイカの肌の模様はキスマークのようにも見えるな(笑) それとイカは全部 squid だと思っていたけど、筒イカのことだけだったのも勉強になったぞなもし(-。-)y-゜゜How many men do you think cuttlefish has seen dieand using it to wash down the cuttlefish he was munching.tentacle　n. 触手 Sweetbread a la Gusteau: Sweetbread cooked in a seaweed salt crust and with cuttlefish tentacle.My favorite part of the Expansion was the lore. As you progress, you unlock chat logs of Pearl, Marina, and Cuttlefish, and it’s super endearing. Pearl and Marina’s dialogue is so real; they joke around but are able to be serious and have down-to-earth moments.captain cuttlefish is a milkshake duckOctopi, whales, dolphins, elephants, corvids (crows, magpies), cuttlefish, great apes and parrots are all on the same order of magnitude of conscious as we are, with some maybe even being smarter and more lucid than humans. We should treat them with immense respect.my dumb explanation for octoexp is piper fell through a sewer grate or w/e, her teammates find her phone and they don't understand what's happening meanwhile she has to put up with cuttlefish being racist and ignoring her but begrudgingly takes up the agent 8 role anywaycaptain cuttlefish files for divorce lqI like how Capt. Cuttlefish mounted Tartar's fucking head on his shack in Octo Canyon after murdering himPearl, upon learning Marina's darker past, immediately disregards it and THREATENS TO KILL CAPN CUTTLEFISH IF HE HARMS HER I was just listening to Radio Lab and I've realized we talk like them. And them is a softer version of Ira Glass. On today's show. The cuttlefish. And why we need them. And why they need us. STAAAAAAAY with us.アタリメ司令の本名は英語だとCraig Cuttlefishか 吉田義男とクレイグワーシントンで阪神つながりだったらいいのに。打ってクレイグ、たのんマースdatin fish princesses i had to learn to like small crabs an cuttlefish Pearl actually had no idea that Marina was an Octoling until Captain Cuttlefish (whose first name we now know is Craig) revealed that she used to be a top scientist for the Octarian army before the end of the first game and she heard Calamari Inkantation for the first time i think its because it was marie who recruited agent 4 maybe cuttlefish doesnt know about her yet because marie said he went on vacation with agent 3 getting through the main story of Octo Expansion, I do love the interaction that Cuttlefish has with Pearl and Marina. I felt like I learn a lot of those two.captain cuttlefish really out here skipping agents 5 6 and 7 just because, huh OCTO EXPANSION BROUGHT THE GOOD FOOD cap'n cuttlefish gets suspect of marina and pearl threatens to "cut a fish" if he tries to hurt her Cuttlefish being quietly racist as shit to Marina. 'I don't see skin colour' 'You're one of the good ones' 'But you're so articulate!'Anyways, the expansion is good but the treatment of racism/xenophobia was terrible and I cannot say I like captain cuttlefish at all and pearl lost a lotta cool points too so I’m just.... hmm...now those three are important BECAUSE according to Wu, the I-Rex gets its ability to change colors from the cuttlefish, it’s ability to change its body heat index from the tree frog and its ability to sense body heat from the pit viperWhen the CEO of the company asks him what the I-Rex is made of he replies with a bunch of different dinosaurs AND a cuttlefish, a tree frog and a pit venom viper DAMN YEAH, i finished it earlier and hooooooly fuck, that was an experience, but i'd also been thinking a LOT about how lowkey racist Cap'n Cuttlefish wasI also thought the story was simple but very fun. The conversations between marina, pearl, and cap cuttlefish were really charming and I love them all so much jdjsjkakakak
