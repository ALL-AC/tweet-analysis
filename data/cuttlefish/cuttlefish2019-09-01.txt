The ‘secret’ signal might not be so secret to any crabs in the vicinity.On the flip side,the signals might not be interpreted by crabs as something assoc. with cuttlefish (or danger).Also, small vertebrate fish (a favorite prey of cuttlefish) probably wouldn’t detect the signals. So, two cuttlefish can exchange signals ‘below the radar,’ w/o having to use the visible light channel—which would otherwise require them to commit their chromatophores, iridophores, leucophores, etc., and thus disable their camouflage faculty, giving away their presence. No worries! You’re right—polarization vision is fairly common across marine invertebrates, incl. crustaceans. In cuttlefish, ‘secret’ signals via the polarized channel may provide a means of communication between conspecifics that doesn’t interfere w/ their camouflage systems.What ever happened to that cuttlefish guy? quisiera ser un cuttlefish para ver por atrás como se va a mear la furichanga And they intelligently assess their surroundings to decide exactly how to camouflage themselves, instead of simply mimicking whatever is nearby.
