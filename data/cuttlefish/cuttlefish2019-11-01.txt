For now.I don’t know which scientist coined the term “precopulatory grey” to describe the color female cuttlefish turn when they’re interested in mating but it’s hilarious I like it.Oh OH! I forgot to mention that when female cuttlefish are interested in mating they turn a color that scientists call “precopulatory grey.”In other words, if a cuttlefish is feeling just okay, it might be have a pale color. When the cuttlefish fish gets hostile, it turns darker extends its arms tentacles to look really big. (I know. That sounds scary.)Cuttlefish.Anyway. The really neat thing about cuttlefish is they can change colors like a chameleon! They use color change to camouflage from predators, to hypnotically lure prey, to communicate with each other!Then the male cuttlefish goes in for a kiss. Okay, that would be romantic but untrue. The male sort of spews reproductive fluid into a pouch next to the female’s mouth but this is Twitter so let’s move along from scientific accuracy go with um *vague gesture* “sex occurs.”Then when the male cuttlefish has demonstrated dominance with that whole “I can stare very hard at other males” routine, he grabs the female with his two tentacles turns her to him, face to face. Kind of dramatic passionate, cuttlefish.So when two male cuttlefish are trying to impress a female cuttlefish, they stare at each other like “I’ll kick your butt!” “No, I’ll kick your butt harder!” then one sighs “Okay you probably can” swims away to court another day. (The sigh is not scientific. I’m guessing.)There are a lot more male cuttlefish than female so courtship is competitive. Males will face each other in a dominance display but they don’t usually fight. They just threaten a lot then one gives up.Cuttlefish have 8 arms and 2 tentacles because I guess 8 arms is never enough? The tentacles have that suction cup like texture so they can get grabby when they want. In case an 8-armed grab is insufficient I suppose. OH or probably for multitasking!
