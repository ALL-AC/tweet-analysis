Tbh since I watched my octopus teacher...I can’t bare the thought of eating Octopus YOU ADDED THEIR OCTOPUS MY HEART 😭😭😭 Wow, 3 whole locations. 1 in a supermarket I probably wouldn't go to (the other 2 supermarkets don't have charging), 1 in a paid car park, the last in a pay and display. That's entirely workable for lots of locals without home charging to adopt EVs and not tread on each other.Update on this: I'd also like a dumbo octopus and a cuttlefish, maybe doing something cute together I just want my gas to work. Thank god the electric works though. I have a EV and need it for that.octopus are aliens i cannot be convinced otherwiseSo I caved and bought the lil emotional octopus plushies.

I want to put my face right in it and get it even wetter with my saliva and cum. If you’re ok with that. Exciting! Ordered! And just because it's great elsewhere, you seem to be unwilling to accept that there'll be plenty of areas exactly like mine. I looked at the 2 other nearby towns. Also slim pickings. Most at specific businesses. My home town is worse. Improvements need to be huge. Kevin! They didn’t jump me? It was only 1!? Wel it must’ve been an octopus You know you all are arguing the same thing. Think of white supremacy as the head of an octopus. Crack, poverty, feminism, counterinsurgency are all tentacles hence the label systemic. One tentacle alone isn't more responsible than the next. It's collective oppression Yeah Europe is so much better to bet, those are good numbers.

OCTOPUS OR JELLO IN CONSISTENCY Stay strong! Time will pass quicker than you think 🤞🏻Just watched the documentary My Octopus Teacher. Fascinating insight into human beings. If the man had been starving to death while he nurtured his young I'm pretty sure that the incredibly intelligent octopus would have fed him. Wwx setting them down so that he’s laying on his back with lwj on top of him, still wrapped around him like an octopus while the rabbits come to greet them 🥺🥺 I already bet a lot. In Europe we were lucky enough that we could bet since like December. I remember putting money on Boseman at 3/1. And lately Octopus Teacher at 10/1. I would def bet money on the latter since Time seems to be fav still and its not WinningWould be so cool to be an octopus Jogando até o talo e enjoar Got in for an early meal at Octopus 😁 fun huh? oki Omg what if once the meeting was done wwx just stood up with lwj still in his arms (bridal carry or octopus) to take him back to the jingshi or to cuddle and nap in the back hills Yes, an octopus and a forest will pet every animal in the world starfish octopusFinally watched My Octopus Teacher. 2 takeaways: 1. Dude wanted to fuck that octopus 2. Octopus was dtf Sad they couldn't make it work I would love to see a big investment in infrastructure to improve this and eliminate the issue. But it needs to happen before you can expect people everybody to buy EVs. octopus fish YES! He's so awkward and I love him so much T^T That would be litty tiddy. I wanna ocean themed sleeve on my arm starting with a big ass octopus on my shoulder/bicep It's funny because you're the one being dogmatic and refusing to accept the difficulty for a lot of people to live with an EV at present. As I've expressed, EVs are great if you can home charge. If you can't, and a lot can't, many people can't easily rely on public charging.ok but where is the octopus Pq?FUCK I MISSED AN HOUR OF BIG Q’s STREAM BC I WAS AT THE FLEA MARKET AND I GOT ONE OF THOSE OCTOPUS PLUSHIES BUT IM STILL UPSET JDJSNXJSJKW I have this is exact octopus!However, any purchases made during the month of April will qualify to enter our small giveaway event ! + Numerous entries are allowed + Overall purchases can be any amount 💛 April Giveaway Product : REVERSIBLE OCTOPUS 💛 [ ONLY APPLIES FOR ONLINE ORDERS ] Lmaooo it’s fine, I like the ocean theme tho... a big ass octopus on the calf maybe??

I can't remember the last time someone died from a funnel-web spider or a blue-ringed octopus. Death by car accident is far more common, and yet most of us happily get into a car every day. I don’t want this anymore… I wanna go back inside my octopus pot… Or maybe a giant pacific octopus. They eat sharks so I reckon they would do a great job on intruders. Guns in homes=bad, giant frikkin octopus in homes=good....simple. Dang it. I would eat everything in this thread.
