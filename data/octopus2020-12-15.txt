They need something to actually affect them like very negative pr to actually make a difference which is why FreeMelee is a thing in the first place imagine a pokemon game selling more than smash bros sure.....in what universeHOYYYY bakit lahat lang talaga octopus nakukuha nila?? Hahahahaha wala bang ibang isda??? Feeling ko pinakawalan to ng staff sa other side ng boat 🤣🤣🤣 again idgaf about your and nintendo's BS I am on neither of your side's, I have no reason to defend anyone I just want the BS fighting to stop bro 낙지도 쫀아 잘 잤어? Except the octopus... Pepperoni but I’d try the lobster I had octopus pizza when I was in Italy didn’t care for it the octopus was rubbery and I think I just couldn’t get the idea of a octopus on pizza click so I’d have to try lobster ty apple autocorrect, currently on the phone, dunno why it swapped it, did not even notice I ment to say angle I'm listening... well now they got this issue on there back oh well, nvm shame they decided to not try and reason with nintendo could have actually made some progress oh there is no doubt the game would have sold more but not by a margin that actually effected there bottom line 19.02 million[2] is alot of copies sold making them a fortune, dispite the bad pr You're looking at 2 things that at their roots are unrelated. National dex was the community taking issue with a creative decision. is the community taking issue with a legal decision. And one that has shown to have worked in the past with enough voices (EVO 2013) Ah, I see you’re an octopus of culture as well 😌 better start making it it's duty if it wants to avoid any further problems slippi could have handled this so much better Splatoon players causing a Splatoon tournament stream to be taken down and subsequently replaced by the biggest tournament they ever had isn't a that big of a deal.  shame u don't understand which angel I am coming from oh well, nvm I saw an octopus living in a cowboy boot. I win. its proof bad pr does little to the bottom line Sword and shield did fantastic despite having it's own hashtag (bringback national dex) that went extremely viral, even to the point where it was being brought up at offical tournaments it is currently there 5th top selling game!! when did potental piracy become legal again, not fair to throw you all under the bus but there is no denying that there will be people without legal copys in that tournament, had it gone through I think you missed a few letters, they now include sentient octopus’s Thanks Kerry. Haven't ordered yet. But, the octopus and spanakopita are calling my name. Cheers!Di ako nakaorder ng octopus plushie ngayon ko lng naalala 😕😭😭😭😭 *looks at how well sword and shield did despite how much the nationaldex tag went viral* Simplesmente descartaram o visual pq era muito assustador para um filme voltado para o público infanto juvenil, mas acredito que o Sam Raimi teria feito um ótimo trabalho. Só olhar a cena do Octopus HM2, este homem sabe gravar um monstro quando quer Give me something in exchange It hurts to look at it For not being on either of your sides You see that as a problem ラーメンの「つけ麺」を日本そばにアレンジしたようなメニューが特徴。トコロテン方式の茹でたて生そばが旨い。 秋頃に「暫く休業」の札が出されて、客との間が狭いので改装かな？とも思ったのですが年内再開はないとお店のひとが話してました。 ただ、引き払ってはいないので再開はすると思います。 nah im gna promo those octopus plushies instead😩😩😩 GET 🗣 THAT🗣 BAG🗣🗣💰💰💰💰💰 They know your issue They don’t care In the slightestunfortunately he volunteered that he’s a pro-cop j*rdan p*eterson stan i had to unmatch. hope he enjoys his new octopus knowledgeSHAWTY LOOKING HOT FOR US, LIL MAMAS GOT LEGS LIKE AN OCTOPUS you can dream of an octopus at noon And the octopus - always the octopus! Seriously impressive in every heist. It brings attention the the issue, and the larger it becomes, the more they'll have to listen. If you can't accept that, that's tough but this is how it's being handled Like no cursing allowed Irony Ya Mum thought octopus but more like spider is right 🕷😱 Our beef is with the corporation doing all of this which is Nintendo. What you're saying is we have beef with Nintendo, and we're dealing with that beef. That does nothing To there bottom line Ok Hey lawyers!!!  I will gladly bring it up again Lawyers Your beef is with them Good pull. No cooking supporting local restaurant. Love Greek food. Did you get octopus or moussaka? Cheers, Ron will have eaten many octopus tentacles🐙 I approached them with Dr., they replied with first names, I replied back with first names, and the conversation seemed to go cordially from there. Oh we are. Through and .Never thought octopus and cheese would go well together, damn 😤 I am on neither of your side Let me make that perfectly clear Ok. Then why do they feel obliged to stop us from playing our game competitively? Gonna bring up the lawyer's argument again? Cause if you do then this is just gonna go in circles. My Octopus Teacher...Netflix It's a tournament, and the teams were there ready to play, what's the issue? If the name was fartfartmcnuggets they could have still kept it up. They held a tournament and since FreeMelee isn't a slur it's an acceptable name If you haven't watched My Octopus Teacher, I just did and it's phenomenal! Great for kids of all ages They are under no obligation To show this nonsense on a livestream There's no responsibility at all what? We're doing this through exposure of what Nintendo has been and is doing. Eventually this will lead to a damage to their pr and they'll have to change. It's real unfortunate that you don't like the process That there lawyers claim they where in the right to do Your beef is with them So do something about it In this case it was contacting the professor about permission to use a photo of an item from the collection they were curating, for an article about a webinar they’d given. Add to that, that Fury won't let AJ stand inside and wallop uppercuts at him either. He's going full octopus arms tieing up on the inside 😂 One time when I woke up from a nap after school, I fr thought my blanket was an octopus Bc I slept so hard It's a Splatoon tournament 🙂 They could have easily just kept the stream up as it's an official tournament. They took down the stream, not anybody else. Simple as that. There lawyers claim they where in every right to do so Your beef is with them Like I said I don’t care who is in the right, you think your in the right, so it’s your responsibility to challenge them on this Not mine I really wanted to like both “Emma.” and “Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey”, but my partner and I struggled with both. I also had MAJOR issues with “The Social Dilemma” and “My Octopus Teacher.” We both thoroughly enjoyed “Hubie Halloween”, and I found “Peninsula” fun enough. The hashtag is a result of Nintendo's actions, if you're gonna be like that, then it's actually Nintendo's fault and this is simply what happens as a result Octopus. If you have not watched my octopus friend on Netflix, it is a must watch. I was so surprised to see you in this! Excitedly told my girlfriend "I met her at an interview once". Can I ask why your segment was about the octopus and not social insects? Did they ask you to specifically speak on octopi or did you choose? 🐙🐙 Cause and effect Nintendo is mad their communities don't like them constantly taking stuff down And the effect is that they make stuff even worse Just an issue of overlapping community’s ㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ그러니까요... 탐색피드 내리다가 아도니스 튀어나와서 깜짝 놀랐어요 ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ왜 인스타에 뜨냐구요쿠쿠ㅜㅜㅜㅜ Just and instance of an overlapping community The hashtag is still to blame Octopus McCoy Theopolis U think Nintendo is under any obligation to show it On a livestream?? Check your dm’s octopus Claim of? Cause and effect Free melee is the cause Taking stuff down is the effectSnort hairy octopus off a hairy chest with Piers MorganPorqué nadie me advirtió que My Octopus Teacher estaba así de bello 😭😭 one thing about Chase Hooper, is that he has a good chin, he'll eat a shot to grab you with those octopus arms The Last Dance followed by My Octopus Teacher If you want it to stop then ask Nintendo to stop being babies by taking stuff down in the first place. If they wanted to they could ignore the Smash community entirely or at least just the hashtag, that's on them Octopus, stingray, orca, dolphins, porpoises, humpback whales, rat fish, sea urchins ect ect 😎yes I live on the west coast lol Still their choice buddy. The hashtag could have had the same amount of influence and they could have just not changed their names. Seems to me like it would depend on context; are we talking with them as a member of a faculty, or a scholar on independent terms? Let me put it as simple as this This whole melee mess has nothing to do with me, no my problem is the fires your setting around it Getting stuff cancelled I enjoy is my problem Idgaf who wins that case, I just want the arguing to stop From smash community and Nintendo Not yet! My Octopus Teacher! It’s on my queue, heard it’s fantastic! .: “Did I just have to post on the internet to see where I can commission octopus? Yes I did.” Me: “No, you didn’t *have* to.” The hashtag they decided to care about. It all comes back to THEIR decision. If the Splatoon players didn't put the tag as their names the stream wouldn't have been taken down. I’ve been with for some time now and have never been offered a tree or an octopus!! 😔 good morning to you and to jaemin octopus ˃ᴗ˂ 3 Dragons 1 FR R Robo Dog Octopus Plush For NFR T-rex? If the tag was not there Would not have gotten taken down I stick it on the hashtag Would not have been taken down if it was not involvedremove the plush octopus. Need me to say it in person for u to ignore them and let them take u to court or something? WE? The SPLATOON COMMUNITY DECIDED TO DO THAT. They support the cause and all on their own did it bro you can't stick that on anybody lmao 제가 스위치를 가지고 있었을 때 가지고 있지 않던 게임은 무엇이었을까요? 1. 스플래툰 2 2. 마리오카트 8 디럭스 3. 슈퍼 마리오 오디세이 4. 대난투 얼티메이트 Splatoon players got that taken down themselves. Or are you about to tell me a melee player picked up Splatoon the day big house was canceled and grinded the NA Open? Vc? Is that a fuckin octopus tentacle The live-stream u got taken down It’s only gonna get worse from here if this keeps up 3 Dragons 1 FR R Robo Dog Octopus Plush For NFR Turtle? With no money? Alright nah you're making less and less sense Y'all's designs are always CHOICE, thinking hard about that octopus tee 👀Do you ship to Canada? Done ps4 I’m octopus’sIm too tired to watch the whole thing in one go but my octopus teacher is already amazing ;0; What exactly are they burning? You said earlier other communities are being hurt right? You do realize said communities helped by themselves, no one forced them to help. Nintendo is the only one actually doing anything, the Smash community literally just made a hashtagThis octopus with habanero i’m eating right now is saving my life Next time just ignore the CD and let them drag you to court Your so confident you will win you don’t have to worry anyway380 firms Narrow Gauge Ventures Nauta Capital Neotribe Ventures Newark Venture Partners Newtown Partners Next100 NFX NGC Ventures Nina Capital Octopus Ventures Ooctane Origin Ventures Orios Venture Partners  I don’t think burning everything around you in retaliation is a realistic method of change More so when there bottom line is not effected Okay so what you're saying is to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for potentially more than one case instead of trying to change Nintendo fundamentally through other means which are much more realistic Tão copiando a ideia do dr octopus do homem aranha 2 I can see that start a fund raiser explain what it's for people will donate sure will take time but will be done eventually Yes, I do thats what you thin can be done start a fund raiser explain what it is for people will donate You can't lose if you can't get the money to fight the billion dollar corporation in the first place. You're REALLY simplifying this man. It costs more than you would think Amy and I live in that fear daily!!! Learned this morning that their are four types of blue-ringed octopus. Two years ago I hadn’t heard of a blue-ringed octopus can I throw in the fact you can make them pay the load if they lose your so condifent you will win I question why the money has not been placed where your mouth is thats on you bro whats the issue? afraid of losing? How much money do you think the community could raise? The community raised around 28k with the Splatoon community tournament iirc. Now compare that to potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars for ONE case. Then think about the fact that there could be multiple cases dolphins in the Caribbean, A big octopus more than 3 or 4 feet across, whales but not close I've been watching a lot of octopus videos on youtube and I just really loce them now hahaSobbing my eyes out at My Octopus Teacher are you KIDDING me you can raise alot of money for a tournament out of spite you can raise it in legal funds, ontop of making them pay for the lawyers if they lose your so confident that your in the right it makes me question why you have not done it already 핫식스는 맛없다 근데 다른 에너지드링크 먹어보면 이건 당연한거임ㅇㅇ except challange them what u think would have happened if the tournament went ahead dispite the CD I had the octopus dumplings and the ribeye steak with truffle mash...wet 💦I have been emotionally ruined by My Octopus Teacher  Yes but that would need to be a separate thing the Splatoon thing had most of the money going towards the Splatoon community. Also like I said this is a case by case thing. Nintendo has been taking down YouTube mod content down too and people won't be able to do much about it I have seen it dude What’s an Oculus? I thought you said octopusI love me some octopus ceviche 🤤😩With the improvement in available video quality and art supplies in the last ten years, I'm really hoping we see the return of Kyle the octopus at some point.  I think verlisify summed it up quite nicely tbh raise the money in promise of fighting nintendo, people would gladily donate if they care enough to make an actual difference I mean you really can't prove they didn't have a copy either. And if they wanted to they could have proved everyone had a legitimate copy and Nintendo would most likely take it down anyway, I'll find their official statement математикаI want the octopus that confirms your mood for Christmas it can be fought back if you choose to you gather a large sum of cash for a fan tournament out of spite (not nocking the tournament btw) but not to fight nintendo in court very oddeveryday I'm rooting for lobster bc I think lobsters look cute but I'm also waiting for octopus and squid bc the aesthetics is different The money went towards the teams competing since the official rewards were just gift cards. The other money went towards charity. The thing is, while there was that money, it was a SPLATOON event and they got the money first and foremost Yes, Lily and the Octopus made me cry and My Sister's Keeper I used to write a lot of fanfics and ngl, I had a long going au where namjoon was part octopus, based on his intelligence and clumsiness. And if that led to other things, well.... Hi how do you get an apple tree please like I said, it is harsh to throw the entire community under the bus for this one it would have been a rough and long road to proving everyone who joins the tournament was holding a legit copy Looking at my emails I've even corresponded with the same person twice but a year apart, with several others in between. :( They can't take down the mod, but they were sponsoring Big House iirc and made them stop the stream specifically because of the mod. Thanks. Just for context, you're the 10th person I've dealt with via email/Twitter for a single issue since 6/11/18 (excl. ). I've spoken to a considerable number by phone. Plus your contractors. Not trying to be a pain but I hope my frustration is understandable. *points to the splatoon 2 livestream* and yes, you prob could I mean you raise aton of money in donations for a fan event yet choose not to put it thowards fighting nintendo The community just made a hashtag and are putting it everywhere, Nintendo is just deciding to ignore it, I wouldn't call that inexcusable behavior unless you're talking about something else My Octopus Teacher is pretty special. And 13th is a must-see. Yeah it’s definitely getting chilly to sit outside. Well, no actually. Because they can't take them to court they can draw attention to their cause like a protest. Nintendo doing that is actually just an attack on its own. And the tournament you're talking about is an official one it seems. They can't really cancel that honestly thats twitter folks считается I would not say it was against the mod itself that's why slippi is still up I could not agree more nintendo should absolutly be giving smash more attention on the competetive side but I am sorry that does not allow the community's behaviour мы тебя не ебали, а в рот не считается бороздуй ты заебал уже как же вы заебали Pacific Rim, Rampage, Mega shark vs Mecha Shark, Monsters: Dark Continent, Clash/Wrath of the Titans, Mega Shark Vs Crocosaurus, Mega Shark Vs Giant Octopus, Big Man Japan On the subject, expecting a plunge Sunday/Monday. Have toyed with the idea of moving to the go tariff for the winter anyway, but not doing many miles at the moment and big battery. And not sure how quick you can change around, suppose I could ask. While that is possible, the reason Nintendo took down the streaming Privileges for Melee was for the modification of Slippi itself. While people can pirate Melee, Slippi is a legal thing on its own, so taking action against a mod really isn't defendable when it comes down to it т ы уже всех заебал haha I don't think I could keep an octopus in the house. I'd be worried it would escape and steal my identity or something.I may or may not have spent the last hour watching human/octopus interaction videos on YouTube. Narrator: "he has" they are awear of it, it ties into the pervoking thing as all it is doing is causing them to retalliate and get things shut down this current tournament for the medals is prob gonna get sacked Nintendo has been doing. Nintendo has been undermining the Smash community since the MLG circuits all those years ago. For the first one here, you're going to need to think about the fact that this is a large corporation, and it would take an enormous amount of money to take Nintendo to court, especially on a case by case basis. The hashtag is used to bring attention to the kinds of things- that one is mostly reguarding the slippy thing while I do think throwing everyone under the bus is alittle overkill, there is no denying that there will be people who would have joined that tournament and not even own an offical copy of the game need to speak to an advisor but i work the hours you are open and no one is responding to my emailsWe return this evening with some with my man then possibly ?? not dragging them to court to sort these messes properly, (resulting in burning everything around them) that hashtag (a bot to support it?? really??) being a ness player (all you do is spam PK fire and back throw, toxic AF) Se bem me lembro o Octopus já estava morrendo nesse arco né? Acho que ele funciona mais em um sexto filme, com ele já bem definido no univero, apresentar ele e pular assim é apressado demaisI ordered the takoyaki plate for my griddle. I saw the price of octopus legs online. I think I might make pancake balls with sausage with it first. A lot cheaper! Right, but in this case the person had both, so I was wondering if it was rude to address them by one over the other. I'll go through these one by one. Poor language is something that's just gonna be a thing in general, assuming you mean cursing. Pirating is not necessary to play games on an emulator, you can take your copy of the game for use on an emulator- Mas justificaria o Electro e o Dr Octopus no Homem-Aranha 3 Oh there was a show on Netflix about an octopus. Shoot, forgot what it was called but heard it was great. Did you watch it?  things smash com are in the wrong poor language pirating (potentially) ignoring nintendo provoking refusing to take any responsability for there actions dragging other community's into there messes copyright infringement modding?

But some people are posting photos of crowded bars!Don’t worry, I attach an tiny little submarine to my pet octopus to hitch him back so he can go out in wild spaces in a supervised setting. Yeah but on top of not supporting it they actively stopped other people from supporting Smash in general which goes beyond just not supporting the Esports. You can post what you have to say about the community now though Like a Looney Tunes anvil. Also, that’s a giant octopus at best judging from the size of the anchor. No big deal. Have you tried the octopus 🦑 arepas, Anya? 😋 You won't find them in the USA. Last universal common ancestor. all organisms now living on Earth have a common descent—the most recent common ancestor of all current life on Earth.
