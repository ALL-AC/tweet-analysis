Faut se faire à l'idée que ça peut servir autt que desservi Remplace "Twitter" par "un bar" et le même schéma s'applique. C'est pas aux femmes de se fermer au monde, c'est au monde de leur laisser de la place. Là dessus je suis effectivement d'accord, la méthode n'est pas toujours la bonne, mais ça fait réagir et c'est nécessaire. Même si c'est maladroit, si on n'en parle pas, comment essayer de regler le problème. C'est la difficulté aussi de tout ça Sauf que ce n'est pas tout le monde qui recherche à recevoir des critiques constructives sur Twitter. Tu dis ça en tant que personnage publique. Je suis totalement d'accord sur le fait que ça doit être véritablement étouffant, mais il faut se rendre compte à l'évidence que Pour autant y'a aussi des personnes venant en DM pour de bonnes raisons et pour des choses intéressantes. Donc elles se privent à cause de choses dont elles ne sont pas responsables 🤷‍♂️ que certains ne savent pas se retenir et être des humains décents, c'est empiéter sur nos droits de base par des solutions qui nous les retirent. C'est pas un raccourci, c'est un autre contexte à ta solution pour te prouver que c'en est pas une. Et non, Twitter s'utilise à d'autres fins. Se fermer à des avis extérieurs qui peuvent être constructifs, avec des moyens de connecter avec des gens autour de même passions parce なんだって…('ω') Mais je suis totalement d'accord. Sauf que le problème est bien plus gros que ça et que râler en affichant des types parfois polis malgré eux c'est jouer le même jeux que ceux qui harcèlent au final. C'est clairement pas avec cette démarche que ça va changer quoique ce soit.Watched the honest trailer and they inserted the "Whiplash" scene with the octopus playing drums....Can't stop laughing... Raccourci dangereux et rien d'autre. Si ya rien à tirer de bon de messages d'inconnus sur un site, arrêtez de vous infliger ça en fait non ? Des moyens de communications entre proche c'est pas ce qu'il manque pour contourner Twitter. 2 girls one octopus Parce que tu crois sincèrement qu'en continuant d'afficher des types sur Twitter le harcèlement même basé sur des dm va s'arrêter ? Si c'est tellement ingérable ces messages pourquoi les laisser ouvert en fait ? C'est une question de logique. Et ramener ça au viol est un Mais c'est pas une vraie solution, juste un écran de fumée. C'est les mentalités qui doivent changer, couper ses DM ne règle pas le problème, le mec ira juste dans les DM d'une autre... Mais c'est juste la vérité en fait ? Ya vraiment des gens qui se sont rencontré sur Twitter, j'ai pas besoin de preuves pour annoncer ça. Peu importe comme ca été fait d'ailleurs. Si les dm te sont indigerable voir oppressant ça sert à rien de continuer à se faire du mal, si ? No, there are just too many I like! Right now I’m really into Ann Braden, because I just finished reading “The Benefits of Being an Octopus” and LOVED it! I miss brendon being a demon or a octopus thing Great!

You’ll get there! gngngn si une nana ne veut plus être violée elle sort pas le soir et pi c tou !!!!!! pourquoi c'est à nous de régler les problèmes de barrière de certains Pour venir en pm oui il faut des raisons particulières... C'est aux relous d'arreter de les envahir. Elles sont où tes stats qui disent que ces couples ont été formés grace à un relou qui est venu dans les dm d'une meuf en lui disant qu'elle est jolie ? Sortir des infos comme ca de son cul n'en fait pas de vraies infos pour autant. C'est pas à la nana de couper ses dm putain 😀😀😀I like how for the first 4 Lost Tapes episodes there were pretty good titles like “Chupacabra” and “Monster of Monterrey” but for ep. 5 it’s simply “Oklahoma Octopus”. Axalotl dragon, octopus dragon, sloth dragon, hermit crab dragon, yeti crab dragon, coconut crab dragon, anteater dragon..? Right?
