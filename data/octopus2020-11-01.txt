Ah yes doctor octopus the well known super hero Octopus had ‘access’ issues to our back board on 1st visit (said they couldn’t work through the gap in the wall as it was) so I enlarged the access and on 2nd visit they fitted a second back board next to the original one to accommodate the smart meter.

I actually don't like octopus but for takoyaki I give it a pass, it gives more texture also it also tops with a sauce and it's hella good omg you should try one day!!

Incluso fabricar computadores. 𝘵𝘢𝘬𝘰 ? [he provides, raising a brow.] 𝘻𝘩ā𝘯𝘨𝘺ú ? octopus ? Se crearian los procesos automatizados que solucionarian todos esos problemas, no subestimes al capital, con plata TODO se puede hacer Y quien produciría la comida para los ricos? Quién mantendría los servidores donde "está" la riqueza? Quién mantendría los servicios básicos? En un mundo donde no hay trabajadores? got my £50 credit today thanks loving octopus, just set my timer on the app. The ZOE is great, using it as much as possible, my PHEV is handy for long long journeys but so far not using that much. brooo i hope we get octopus at some point when i’m back Serian mas ricos, ellos nunca pierden Libertad y desarrollo po, es como citar a la fundacion sol ajajjjaja i'd be happy to let the country be run by a fortune telling octopus compared to this lot. Y qué pasaría con los ricos? El pobre se muere de hambre, el como ultimo eslabon de la cadena siempre sera lo mas delgado y el mas perjudicado ¿Qué pasaría si todos los trabajadores del mundo decidieran no trabajar más y generar riqueza metiendo lo q puedan juntar en instrumentos financieros? I think my next electricity supplier switch will lead me this way. Do I recall you are with octopus? And then they send you like 20 pictures of some weird jellyfish they found and only 1 of the cute octopus that hides under its own arms. 🥺 El capitalista pone su capital en el banco, acciones, fondos mutuos, APV, depositos a plazo y automaticamente genera ganancia, no aplica siempre lo que dices, NO ES IMPOSIBLE, no generar riqueza sin humanos. Yo solo te respondi a tu ejemplo del restaurante consider it dookie filled Show D one of your octopus dishes Paul. Me sorprendes mi Bat q gustes del genero progresivo, hay scucha algo de Gentle Giand (Octopus) ¿Te estás leyendo? Sin el trabajo humano es IMPOSIBLE producir o generar riqueza, los capitalistas necesitan que existan trabajadores q directa o indirectamente aporten al proyecto. Entonces, las utilidades de un rico existen por ese trabajo, sin el no existen. Maybe I can do some phasmo madness with ya I’ll keep ya posted brotha No son imprescindibles como siempre dicen ser, menos ahora, el aumento de inmigrantes se debe a que el propio chileno no aprovechaba las oportunidades laborales. Por eso nos convertimos en el paraiso de sudamerica, pero eso ustedes lo ven de otra forma She has a little dumbo octopus friend :) La cafeína es ayuna es por el tener el Cortisol en niveles altos. Lo ideal es dejar pasar mínimo una hora desde que despiertes para bajar ese nivel del cortisol. aporta tú, que sabes cómo va eso. Son procesos que no dependen del restaurante, el solo esta abocado a tener el menor numero de trabajadores contratados para hacer mas rentable su negocio y eligio porsupuesto a la empresa de servicios mas barata, asi se ahorra costos de finiquitos, aumentos, sindicatos y etc. Wish you had some video of this octopus! Alright, what’s your offer? Old toys I have btw are octopus plush, marsh plush, caticorn rattle, panda frisbee and some more Toda la producción humana necesita de humanos para funcionar. Entonces, siempre habrá humanos aportando para la generación de tu riqueza. Humanos q ganan más o menos según la valoración q se hace de su trabajo. Pero siempre alguien tiene q hacer las cosas.also, I checked the dictionary to confirm that the plural of "octopus" is "octopuses"Thank you all for a wicked fun stream as I crocheted an octopus, gave my tips on learning a new language, and told random stories! See you on Tuesday for more Gabriel Knight! Quien hace el lavavajillas, quien lo vende, quien lo transporta, quien lo instala?

Never thought I'd call a spider adorable but holy heck adorable And the octopus is such a sweetie Only boobs in it are the big giant octopus lady monster thing Lavavajillas, autoservicio y empresa subcontratista de aseo, le paga a una empresa para que se haga cargo del “cacho” de el personal que el necesita, asi estan funcionando en muchos lados, mal ejemplo.questa è discriminazione verso gli octopusho fatto punto con angy e non con l'octopus omg the lil octopus hairstyle I second anything by David Attenborough! My Octopus Teacher is beautiful (but very bittersweet). Si el rico usa su capital para poner un restoran, ¿genera riqueza si no hay nadie que haga la comida, que sirva las mesas, que lave los platos, q limpie el piso, q lleve las cuentas? Gay Male Octopus Definitely Steve. And whilst pol claim "No known association" you can bet your life that it's all been discussed on forums. So many similarities in use of language ( "octopus arms" is a classic) and it's obvious that people share and spread ideas. Rewarding lies spreads them. Y las alzas de impuestos en economías firmes con institucionalidad estable (como la chilena) no genera fuga de capitales. Si no en Europa no quedaría nadie. Nop, la riqueza se genera con el capital del rico y la administracion de este. El pobre es el ultimo eslabon de la cadena, hace lo que los procesos automatizados no pueden鯛 （sea bream） 蛸 （octopus） 太刀魚　（frost fish） 鱈 （cod） 蝶鮫 （sturgeon） The Squid Squad knows what’s up!!! We welcome our Lovecraftian-adjacent team to the list of Allies taking the “pledge” Question; Did they sign in blue, black or Octopus ink?? Es un ciclo económico, suben los sueldos, sube el consumo, sube la producción, suben las ganancias de los empresarios. Y todos pagan impuestos según esas ganancias para corregir desigualdades y mantener una estructura institucional q permita q todo eso ocurra. Thanks Michelle! Like the octopus!—Él tambien está lidiando con eso mismo, ¿cómo cree que le ha dejado? Angry octopus noises— Pero si el fin del estado es organizar la vida social para que las personas puedan realizar sus proyectos de vida, todas "sus ganancias" deberían irse en eso... Los pobres generan la riqueza de los ricos trabajando para ellos. Son parte de la cadena productiva y deberían ser retribuidos de forma proporcional. No podemos ser todos emprendedores, nuestro sist económico se basa en la división del trabajo. “Going to tame an octopus” is so very  Nop, es echar a un saco roto, es plata que no tiene ningun retorno, inversion es cuando pones dinero en algun lado y te genera utilidades, ¿que utilidad da lo que dices?, y las mejoras de salario las pagan las empresas no el gobierno that’s a crab, o no wait there’s the octopus, ok If ya sushi's carcass isn't also brought to the table, still breathing, is it even fresh?

Pq los pobres no pagan impuestos. Entonces... No esta para mantener a la gente, eso es pobreza a largo plazo, ¿que sacan con hacer una constitucion llena de derechos si no hay impuestos que la financien? Mira argentina, llena de subsidios y derechos sociales, totalmente quebrada casi al nivel de venezuela, hace poco.... No, intento cambiar el mensaje de que si se pueden lograr las cosas, trato de derrumbar ese discursillo nefasto que andan repitiendo de que el estado tiene que darles todo. Principalmente porque no es sostenible a futuro, un estado se alimenta de los impuestos de las personas...my friends gifted me this mood octopus thing and the in life skz album and this made me so happy now i have all the things i wished for my bday I really liked them so far!

Octopus is like a proto-western but McTeague (1899) is the better introduction, a brisk read with a great finale vivid descriptions of pre-1906 SF. Also basis for the legendary "Greed" What people need to understand is that it is like an octopus, the head (CPP-NPA) has so many tentacles (Kabataang Makabayan, Bayan Muna, LFS, etc) working on various sectors of the society and according to the reports, they usually guise themselves as action/support groups. The octopus is lying in a small lake. If you look at my tweet from 10/24/2020, you can see it better there. Yas. Obviously the Coypu would have wanted to see a Coypu in there. Not an Octopus!

Y pensar eso es de una pobreza intelectual y moral tremenda.those lil plush octopus things are so adorable 🥺🙆🏾‍♀️I’ve got my Bone Frog and my Bone Octopus out... maybe I’ll leave them all year. They’re fun! are hopeless. I moved to them, they installed faulty smart meters and their home monitors were inaccurate as their billing system was so complex. Moved to as soon as I could.

No he's not, the creators said like 2 years ago that he's an octopus Curled octopus - Eledone cirrhosa I don’t recall doing that. I ticked a box to indicate my interest in the Go tariff, and then, some months later, the meters were fitted. Do you have a record of my agreement to the beta terms? Could you email it to me if so.

It's like they got a weird octopus type creature (who is going to destroy the earth in a year) as their teacher and the class is supposed to k word that dude before it. It's really good 👌😭Octopi are aliens. That's right, aliens. They came here for our plethora of water and then created Atlantis. But when Atlantis is lost, so is their technology and knowledge.

It and the octopus documentary and the fungus documentary are my future.2/3 of an octopus' intelligence is in its tentacles (film, My Octopus Teacher). What a challenge this is to the mind-body divide that is prominent in Western thinking. In much of my research, I look at embodied learning and embodied knowledge.  Hay millones de casos de gente que salió adelante y que hoy viven mucho mejor que hace 30 años. La movilidad social en Chile es la más alta de latinoamérica.
